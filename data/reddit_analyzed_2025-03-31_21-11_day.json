    "selftext": "i'm new to all of this and kinda confused as to which credit card should I go for (the cc will be issued in my dad's name and then i'll get an addon since I can't get one yet). so the thing is my dad has a regalia gold ltf and literally no other cc. it's all he uses and he doesn't have that spends on credit card either (like 10-20k max in a month). i've been trying to understand credit cards and all to get him to issue a good cashback/rewards card as well so at least I can also use it. I am right now in college and often order everything for home as well as for me online and food deliveries as well mostly from my account only. I often need to travel to and from my college so I'm thinking I can issue an add on regalia for me to get the lounge access. for the rest I'm confused between sbi cashback, hdfc swiggy and airtel axis as to which would benefit me the most. out of 4 my family has 2 airtel sims so I thought airtel axis might help in that situation but it has lower cashback at other spends compared to sbi and swiggy. also is the fd backed one card any good anymore? i've seen a lot of people claim that the rewards on a lot of sites through this card has gone down so would appreciate the perspective of a holder on this card as well.\n\n(also if any card that has good cashback or rewards and also provide railway lounge would be a plus since I often travel by train as well from a station that has a good railway lounge). \n\nthanks",

Not a way to earn money.\n\nYou better focus on learning stocks and other investments. You will earn more than credit card rewards.\n\n\nI suggest that everyone don't use other credit, especially your parents. You will never understand, how to manage your spending if you do that",
      "i understand your point but I don't blindly spend like that. what happens is Amazon prime, Swiggy One, Zepto Pass etc are on my number so often whatever has to be ordered I am the one who does when my parents tell me to. and for offline purchases my dad uses his regalia. what I meant was to try to get decent enough cashbacks on the online spends I am already doing anyway. so indirectly while I am the one ordering my dad is the one paying anyway since I use his upi/amazon pay balance for all of these purchases.\n\nfor spends done by me all of it is done by upi and tbh the biggest payment on my upi account is like 250-300 and that too because I had to buy medicines when I sick else in everyday spends it's like 20-30 rupees max."

      "You're breaking the cardinal rule (well, maybe more of a rule of thumb) of credit cards. \n\n###Don't go for point based cards for annual expenses below 4L.\n\nYou haven't actually provided the breakdown of your expenses so it's impossible to provide any suggestions but you definitely won't benefit from a reward point card. Actually, I'm curious. What made you want a rewards card in the first place?\n\nEven without knowing your expenses, I can very confidently say that cards like SBI Cashback, HDFC Swiggy, HDFC Tata Neu Infinity, ICICI amazon pay and/or HDFC Millennia would be the right cards for you. You already have the best card for dining. \n\nIDFC Millennia and ICICI Rubyx are worthless. I doubt you'll find any use for them.",
      "I don't think you should go for earning RPs at this moment. The best value cards for you would still be cashback cards - ICICI Amazon Pay, Flipkart Axis, SBI Cashback or HDFC Swiggy. Save money now,  and hopefully when your income grows over time you can go for paid cards that offer good rewards like HDFC Infinia, ICICI EPM or Axis Magnus Burgundy. There are a number of LTF cards that give 2+ domestic lounge access per quarter, you can search this sub for details. \n\nIn case you still want to plan ahead and earn RPs starting today, you broadly have two options to choose from (as per your income eligibility):\n\n1. Amex Platinum Travel: Gives over 8% rewards if you can hit the 4L yearly milestone. However, this value is assuming that you're going to transfer those points to Mariott or international airline partners. It is just my assumption, but I don't think someone whose expenses are under 4L annually would prefer to stay at such expensive properties today but maybe 3-5 years down the line you may use it for some travel like honeymoon or an anniversary trip for example. The good thing is that points do not expire.\n\n2. The other option is Axis Atlas. Even for Axis, you get best value only when you transfer your RPs to Accor which is an international hotel partner. Now Accor has a wide range of options and in my experience, you have some affordable hotels too where you can stay while spending lesser points in comparison to Mariott. The major drawback is that Axis has a number of exclusions (insurance, utility bills, gold/jewellery purchases to name a few).",
      "Use SBI cashback for all online transactions - wherever you don't have any offer greater than 5% from any of your owned cards.\nFor offline. Juggle between any cards you already have",
      "[deleted]",
      "Totally.\n\nI find it hard to believe that anyone spending 3L is gonna be spending money at Marriott or Accor.\n\n\n\nYou'll get points to stay for highly discounted or even totally free, but are you saving anything? Nope, cause you never spent money in these categories in the first place.\n\n\nNow, start spending to just redeem the points. Travel, food, shopping (usually, we spend decent amount on souvenirs or other gifts for relatives & friends when we travel somewhere, don't we?)",
      "You forgot the most imp. point about Amex. Can you guess it?",
      "Please do not give advice about credit cards, ever.",
      "How? OP has an overall spends of below 3L annually, and that is spread across 5 different categories. This is terrible advice!",
      "Would Amex plat travel be useful if Op can't spend 4L on it in a  year (assuming max 25k x12=3l)",
      "Worst advice ever",
      "Unless you can EASILY make it to 4L spends, only then get the amex travel platinum. So many times amex wont even work.\n\nPs. Amex has stopped taking applications for the time being.",
      "Yeah I know they are not accepting applications at the moment. This is just assuming they probably resume applications by end of next month, there has been some chatter around that on forums but nothing official yet.",
      "Tbh no\n\n\n\n4L milestone is what makes it worth it.\n\n\nPlus. I find it hard to believe that someone who spends 3L in a year is gonna be spending money at Marriott, so basically the points are adding no actual value, cause they are not saving money, cause they never spent there in the first place. Instead, they'll now start spending money to redeem the points (travel, food etc)",
