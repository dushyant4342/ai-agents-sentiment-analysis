    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I have been a lurker here for a long time and have read many posts here to understand if I can figure out my needs. I have been using credit cards since 2011 and I have quiet a few(one too many in my opinion). Before I begin let me give my details:\n\n* Current Cibil: 790\n* Age: 38\n* Monthly Income and Employment status: Salaried, 2.7 Lakhs per month takehome.\n* Monthly Expenses & Spending Patterns: EMIs for an old personal loan, Rent, Swiggy, Fuel, Bills, Not too much left to invest other than NPS via salary and some SIP's.\n* Top 5 Monthly spend categories and Top 5 Annual spend categories: Rent, Travel, \n* Preferences for Credit Card Features: Need travel benefits as I am travelling a lot for work and otherwise.\n* Reward Preference (Cashback or Reward Points): Agnostic as I have a mix of both in my current portfolio\n* Lounge Access Required: Not really as I find BOM T2 and DEL T3(my most frequented) lounges to be jam packed almost always!\n* Other Special Needs: Fuel/Utility bills\n\nBelow are the cards I already have:\n\n* Citi Premier, now Axis Horizon - Used to keep it for travel points conversion\n* HDFC Regalia Gold - Use now only for lounge\n* HDFC Tata Neu Infinity - Use to book Taj hotels\n* HDFC Swiggy LTF - Swiggy usage on a daily basis\n* SBI Elite - Rarely use, keeping it for the 2 tickets/500 free monthly\n* SBI BPCL Octane - Fuel spends reward points\n* ICICI Amazonpay - Use rarely now as most shopping is now one/two times a year\n* ICICI AdaniOne Siganture - Use for travel bookings/Lounge\n* Kotak PVR - Movie tickets\n\nI also used to have a Zomato/RBL card which is now discontinued and a Slice Card which is also now discontinued. The AdaniOne, Neu and Swiggy cards were added in previous 6 months.\n\nI want suggestions to reduce my cards as I see there are few which are not kept in my wallet and I hardly use them. My main usage is for hotels for work travel which I pay and later reimburse from my company. Usually 6-10 nights a month at 10-12k per night is usually spent by me. I currently use Tata Neu to book Taj hotels when they are in my budget(which off late is not many). I also used AdaniOne, Agoda, [Hotels.com](http://Hotels.com) but the benefits were not that great because I get better benefits when I book direct on [marriot.com](http://marriot.com) or [accor.com](http://accor.com) or clubitc.com. Other than this the other spend is on fuel, occasional shopping on Myntra/Amazon. I also do a bit of personal travel when I do book hotels but these are usually 5-10 days a year. Should I continue this? If so which card should I use in the hotel payments to maximise my rewards/cash back?  \n  \nI have never used HDFC Smartbuy to book hotels, but I have heard about it on this sub, same for Axis' portal. Should I switch to those? I had converted my HDFC points to marriot points and had a great deal last year end when I did a gift card purchase from HDFC Smartbuy for marriot points.   \n  \nI use swiggy on a daily basis for 200-300 rupees and I found HDFC Swiggy card to be great. Kotak PVR has been a mix with some surprise cashback and not really much otherwise. The Tata Neu card is great for Taj/Air India bookings, but other than that I don't see much value for this. The UPI payments for small payments is a good usecase for the card, but some vendors have stopped using this.\n\nMy monthly rent is 45k and I wanna know if I can use any cards to still pay rent. I stopped using CC for rent about 2 years ago when the banks started charging for rent payments. I wanna know if still things are same or is there any benefit for rent payment via cards?\n\nI also have a school fee payment for my kid of 1.65-1.75 lakh per annum as of now. Currently it is direct transfer to school. Can I do this through any CC to gain anything?\n\nI also have small utility bills of 1-1.2k on power and 1.2k on phone+data per month, should I get a Airtel card for this? \n\nI have never tried AMEX in my life, should I jump into that bandwagon? I had asked my HDFC RM for a infinia card and  got denied about 2 years ago with a lower salary, should I check again?\n\nSorry for the very long multi-question enquiry. Hope the experts here can help me to optimise my card strategy!",

But all of my credit card applications got rejected with only vague responses like 'not meeting bank criterias' so far I have applied, SBI simplysave(I have my savings account on SBI), Axis Flipkart, Slice, Kiwi. \n\nI don't have credit history as I've never owned a card before. I really need this like my life depend on it, I need a credit of around 70k. Is there any bank or card that I can get with easy approval without living credit history, lower salary threshold, living in non-tier1, 2 cities? \n\nThanks",

      "4 rejections in short time.  Wait 2/3months before you apply anything. SBI usually dont reject applications. No one can promise the credit limit, you may get 1lac or end up with 10k. \n\nSave up, use someone else’s card. \n\nOr Look for Bajaj EMI card, in offline stores, they usually will issue you loan with a little down payment! After you pay the emis on time, your credit score will be there, and eventually get other cards.",
      "If you have any salary account with some bank, go to their branch and ask for a cc in person",
      "Unfortunately no. Other applications are also gonn be rejected. Cc is not the route.",
      "Try applying for IDFC First Classic ,One Card. \nThese are card that are very generous with their Credit Limit.",
      "Try IDFC's FD backed card, FirstWOW",
      "You can try bajaj emi card.",
      "I think you should cool off for few months, in the mean time, if you are so in need of a work laptop, why don’t just use Debit card EMI?\nOne more thing, if your salary of 20k, you don’t need a 70k laptop, just get Debit card EMI on a 50k laptop max. \n\nM1 version of macbook air will cost you less than 60k and do almost any work you throw at it. \n\nMake sure you are not manufacturing spends and lying to yourself for a 70k gaming laptop when you don’t need it to begin with. Trust me, hold that urge and don’t go on that slippery slope.",
      "Can't you just get the laptop with Amazon paylater emi?",
      "Alright, thanks. Is the offline process different from online ones?",
      "I only have savings account. With SBI and UCO. I normally get my salary on my sbi. But since they rejected my application and told me to reapply after 3 months on Yono app. Can I get a different result by going to their branch office?",
      "I'll try those, but how is their approval criterias?",
      "About FD cards, as I have researched. Suppose I need to buy a 70k item on emi at amazon, if I have 35k to deposit, I'll be getting 35k credit. And will be able to purcahse the emi, right?",
      "I can't use my debit cards for emis, there isn't an option to use them in my apps",
      "If you go to a store and opt for Bajaj EMI, by giving downpayment and all, chances of approval is 99%. But if you apply for Online Bajaj Emi card, it may decline as per your cibil. So if you are in urgent need of credit, go offilne. \n\n\nPS   DO NOT CONTINUE THIS BAJAJ EMI CARD, after this loan emi of 3months, try getting a credit card, and whne yiu get, close this bajaj card. Bajaj suck a big time, and credit card is a better option than this.",
      "Well I got One card when I was In college with a pocket money of 2k. \nIDFC is handing out cards with nice limit to anyone who is on a payroll.",
      "I believe so, but double check if EMI transactions are allowed on this type of card.\n\nThey should be, but just in case",
      "Can you elaborate? Amazon gives you the option to debit card EMIs, with some apps you can even do BNPL wallets without a credit card. What are your referring as “my apps” here, are you limited to some specific app?\n\nIf SBI is the problem, rather than applying for credit card, create a savings account in HDFC, tell them you want to move your salary account there. This will get you a HDFC debit card, amazon supports HDFC debit card EMIs all year long, same you can do with ICICI, reliance digital supports ICICI debit card EMIs.",
      "Thanks, that's a really helpful tip. Yeah Bajaj are sometime sketchy even from my experience, I once had a demat account there, even after complaining to deactivate the account, they still add me to their holders list",

      "They won't let me proceed without a credit history haha, I don't have one so it's basically the end. \n\nhttps://ibb.co/sdZCkC9f",

      "HDFC will issue debit card kit on-the-spot, activation takes a day. How you hold two SBI accounts? Last time I asked, they said, one account per person.",
      "That's really neat, is it the same all over india but I've heard they require atleast 2000 deposit to open an account. \n\nAnd Sorry for phrasing it that way, I meant 1 on sbi and 1 on Uco bank.",
      "Yes, they do have some minimum balance criteria. I am not sure though how much.",

Go through all threads about the card and take it if it works out great.,\n\n  \nCash depends on the country you travel to, some ask for 200USD in hand, some for 100USD etc.  You can either take a forex card or have currency converted to USB at forex spots like Thomas cook etc."

    "selftext": "23(M) earning ₹66,000 per month with a salary account in HDFC. I've been using credit cards since 2022. My credit journey began with a Slice BNPL card, which wasn’t a true credit card. Initially, it had a limit of ₹10k, but now the borrowing limit has increased to ₹1.24 lakh. Later, I was offered an ICICI Coral Visa card (₹60k limit) since I had a savings account with ICICI. They also gave me a Coral Rupay card with a shared limit.\n\nRecently, I made a mistake by getting the HDFC Swiggy card instead of a core card and then added a Tata Neu Plus card (shared limit of ₹50k for both). Last week, I applied for an Amazon Pay ICICI card and got it with a separate limit of ₹60k. All three cards (Amazon Pay ICICI, Swiggy, and Tata Neu Plus) are lifetime free (LTF).\n\nIn reality, I would love to get the HDFC Millennia card, but people say it’s tough to get after having co-branded cards. Many suggest applying for the HDFC Freedom card first and then upgrading it to Millennia later. I see people applying for the Freedom card via Paytm – should I go for that? Is that the right approach?\n\nI also feel the need for a core SBI card if so which one to go for.... Additionally, I’ve been hearing a lot about Kiwi Credit – is it worth getting?\n\nMy CIBIL score was 780 but recently dropped to 776 due to 4 hard inquiries. Is my card mix good, or should I make changes? Any advice would be helpful.\n\nTL;DR: 23M earning ₹66k/month. Current cards: Slice (BNPL, ₹1.24 lakh limit), ICICI Coral Visa (₹60k), Coral Rupay (shared limit), HDFC Swiggy + Tata Neu Plus (shared ₹50k, both LTF), Amazon Pay ICICI (₹60k, LTF). Would love HDFC Millennia but heard it’s tough after co-branded cards; is getting hdfc Freedom first via paytm, then upgrading to Millennia, a good approach? CIBIL dropped to 776 due to multiple hard inquiries. Need a core SBI card. Is Kiwi Credit worth it? Looking for portfolio advice.",

They've been stuck at the ₹60k mark for the past three years. These cards were offered to me when I was a student. Is there a way I can request a limit increase? I used to use them the most until recently, before getting employed.\n\nAlso, what about an SBI core card? I often see good offers around SBI cards. I had planned to apply for the SBI Cashback card, but I believe instant bank discounts don’t apply to it, so I didn’t feel it was worth it.",

      "OP you have a fantastic credit score. I think if your credit age is high, you can get some good cards from HDFC (like regalia gold), or AXIS (flipkart, atlas) but I am not very sure. If your company has tie ups with any bank (where they offer to open salary a/c), you can probably ask them for eligibility. Anyway, I think you can get an ICICI cc like coral/rubyx/sapphiro as an LTF and build your credit history. The cards aren’t great but they have a BOGO offer on BMS.\n\nYou can also search the sub for some similar questions where folks have answered with a good amount of analysis.",
      "I would suggest you to wait for 3 months pay cheque atleast then start your journey with Cashback cards. SBI Cashback can be your first choice.

      "I am sorry I am very new to this. What should my spending patterns be for HDFC millennia vs Swiggy or SBI\n\n  \nAnd will they verify my 3 months statement before issuing the card?",
      "HSBC live+ looks interesting. Will they be very strict on the salary criteria? It may take upto a year for me to change my job and increase my salary.",
      "Then you can try out SBI cashback (low acceptance rate), SWIGGY HDFC (best if you have high amount of spends on Swiggy, had good acceptance but they keep changing the terms and recently saw some people’s posts where they got rejected), or Amazon ICICI (great if you have amazon prime, even without that 3% CB on amazon and 1% otherwise).\nSince your company do not have tie ups, but you have a salary acc, I think you can reach out to your RM in ICICI. They should help you figure out some solution. Though most of the ICICI core cards are pretty useless, even the lounge access have high spend criteria now.",
      "In SBI Cashback you will get 5% Cashback on almost all online spends except few categories like EMI, utility, rent, insurance, wallet, jewellery etc. So it is the best Cashback card as on today but found reports regarding its poor acceptance.\n\nHDFC Swiggy vs HDFC Millennia have both advantages and disadvantages of their own. Read their features and terms or search for other post to understand them better and then settle with one. One reason to prefer Millennia I already mentioned. Similarly if you have big spends on Swiggy you might prefer the other one.\n\nMost banks ask for atleast three months payslip and statement for CC processing if not pre-approved, specially if you don’t have a credit age. That’s why I suggested you to wait. That will reduce further chance of rejection.",

IT'S LIKE FIRE AND FORGET MISSILES, YOU FIRE AT BANK AND LET THEM RUN HERE AND THERE TO SETTLE THE MATTER..... that is ofcourse if you're in the right and have sufficient evidence to support your claim in my case digital payment record. I just tracked it for excitement as my first experience but I never had to do anything else after filing the grievance it was the bank that did all the work.",

      "You're right. Slice was never a credit card. It was a prepaid instrument. Except that in this case, the pre-payment was done by the NBFC and the dues were recovered monthly to make it act like a credit product. This is why it was made to shut down by RBI.",

      "I don't mean literally everyone, basically most companies have an escalation matrix, follow it all the way to the top. Ideally you should reach out to RBI ombudsman if everything fails, so they could probably throw out your case as you didn't try enough(this is my understanding, others can add to it).",
      "Your appeal will be dismissed. Deal with all possible ways of contacting them first. The services were set up to stop companies from screaming you over, not for your doing your work.\n\nI do not want to be rude, but you are making companies easier to get judgement in their favor. They can just say that you should make a new complain, directly to someone higher up. That's it.",

The remaining cards are not being used much.\n2. Suggest the best card for **utility payments** (bills/recharges) from my collection or recommend a better one.\n3.

Should I close the FD and get a better card instead?\n\n# About HDFC Millennia\n\nMillennia is the only card with an annual fee (₹1,000). All the other cards are lifetime free (LTF). I switched to Millennia during the Big Billion Days as it offered better deals than Axis Flipkart at the time. However, I don’t see many offers now.\n\n* How can I optimize the use of Millennia?\n* Which cards from my collection should I close?\n\nLooking forward to your suggestions! 😊",

My main hesitation is that it’s a partnership with UNI—I’m generally not a fan of FinTechs like UNI and Slice. However, I am looking for a lifetime-free card with a 0% forex markup for future use. Here’s what I’ve considered so far:\n\n1. AU Ixigo: The application process seems tough, and my home PIN isn’t serviceable. Not sure if my work PIN is covered, and I’m currently in WFH mode.\n\n2. Federal Bank Scapia: I’ve heard onboarding has been paused. Also, I’d prefer a core Federal Bank card, so I’m skipping this one.\n\nMy Current Cards:\n\n1. Amazon Pay ICICI\n\n2. Axis Flipkart & Axis Neo (Rupay)\n\n3. HDFC Millenia\n\n4. SBI SimplyClick\n\nRecent Inquiries (last month):\n\n1. ICICI: Tried for the LTF Coral Rupay, hoping it would complement my Amazon Pay ICICI for ICICI-specific offers—request was denied.\n\n2. HDFC: Applied for the Swiggy HDFC Card (still in process).\n\n3. SBI: For SBI SimplyClick.\n\n4. Axis: Requested a limit enhancement.\n\nIf anyone is using this card, could you share your experience with it, including the application process?

The same year I enrolled in college and got my first credit card slice student card via college id.\n\nI always maxed out the card during my college years and used to pay the emi on time and then take money from it back and forth for years. I used to pay emi and take that money back in my account.\n\nThen at age 20 I got my first credit card hdfc moneyback+ and luckily at time I understood what is credit utilisation as I didn't blew that card as the limit was really good but as I was in college I had aspirations and as my slice card was max out I used to take cc loans from that card but credit utilisation didn't go above 50% and the main reason was spending on food. \n\nAt age 21 i got another card if kotak and leaned that cards are ltf and it was great.so all those years of my college being over I had a debt of around 80k and for 2 years I was just using slice to pay emi and take back the new amount.\n\nSo when I was 22 I started to learn about finance I took a personal loan from hdfc at just 12 % and made a emi which was just under my allowance. I used to pay extra emi for that loan and I paid that debt in 2 yrs am not working and it was all my monthly allowance that I used to pay.\n\nCurrently I have a cibil of 776 card usage under 20% and have some good cc.\n\nMy key insight is take a cc when you are young so that the mess you create would be manageable as I didn't got any pocket money before I turned 18. So I had no idea how to use it properly and the thing is I have heard all these things on internet earlier but when I got into the trap I realised wtf I can't order from Zomato today because I won't have money to pay for my cc. I never believed in taking loans from friend or I would have f***ed up more.\n\nSo that's all I hope you can understand my story and know how use your cc wisely.",

    "selftext": "\n\nNow that I've got your attention with my rather impressive collection, read on!\n\nI've been a credit card enthusiast since 2015, and over the years, I've reaped the rewards—vacations, freebies, and even social status and bragging rights :P. But I've also learned a few valuable lessons along the way, which I felt was important to share:\n\n1. Too Many Cards is Overwhelming & Unsustainable\n\nManaging more than 10 cards and trying to over-optimize rewards on each one can turn into a part-time job. Credit cards should be a convenience, not a hassle.\n\n2. All Good Things Must Come to an End\n\nIf a credit card sounds too good to be true, it probably is. DCB and Magnus eventually got devalued. Exploit them while it lasts, but don’t bank on them sticking around for long.\n\n3. Rewards is not “Savings”\n\nSpending more can get you cashbacks, points, or vouchers, which might seem like savings, but they’re not. Real savings come from spending less. \nINR 2L in investments/savings always beats 2L credit card points.\n\n4. “There’s Always Gonna Be Another Mountain”\n\nTop-Tier cards won’t bring lasting happiness. I chased after the Infinia card for years, and when I finally got it, I immediately started eyeing the next better card. High-end cards can be exciting and mysterious because of their exclusivity and perks, but they won’t fill any deep voids.\n\n5. There are no Free Lunches\n\nPeople who take luxury vacations and first-class flights using points either spend a TON on their cards or have jobs where work-related travel and expenses are reimbursed by their companies. Trying to match their spending to chase your free vacation paid with points can lead to financial disaster.\n\n6. Your Credit Limit is Not your Spending Power\n\nA high credit limit not a license to spend beyond your means. This growing trend of millennials and Gen-Z maxing out their cards and being unable to payback is concerning. A credit debt trap can wipe out your financial freedom and mental peace. Your spending power is at most your salary/income.\n\n7. Beware of No-Cost EMIs\n\nBig-ticket purchases on EMI can psychologically trick you into forgetting how much you’re actually spending. I’ve seen my friends end up in an EMI pile-up, lose track of multiple EMIs across multiple cards, and their entire credit limits being maxed out from the outstanding balances. A good rule of thumb: limit yourself to one active EMI across all cards at any given time.\n\nMaster the plastic (or metal), don’t let it master you.",

So i thought of giving a try to these fintech lenders like Slice, One card, cred and Fi money.\n\nI don't know anything about them how they work what are their conditions and what do they charge so some of my questions are \n\n1. Do they have an interest free period like traditional credit cards \n2. What are their eligibility criteria \n3. What are their transaction fees criteria \n4. It is good to use for a student \n5. Are they LTF\n6. And most importantly are their any hidden charges \n\nPlease let me know about these things and do suggest some LTF credit cards. ",

It's a bank, don't rely on fintechs, if you want, I would just suggest onecard as they seem to be a bit more trustworthy to me than all these like cred, slice etc.\n\n>1. Do they have an interest free period like traditional credit cards \n\nLol why would they even call them credit card if they did not. Yes, they do have it. So my sons IDFC wow statement is generated on the 17th or something every month and gets until the 2nd or 3rd of the next month to pay it off.\n\n>What are their eligibility criteria \n\nNot sure about the others but for IDFC and onecard, I think a minimum FD of 10k is required against which you'll get a credit limit, like if you do a 10k FD, you'll get 10k limit on your card.\n\n>What are their transaction fees criteria \n\nThere are never any transaction fees for the users, they are levied to the merchants.\n\nIf you mean card membership fee or something, then idfc and onecard are lifetime free. \n\n>It is good to use for a student\nYes, it builds a credit score since you're a new adult which can help while getting any type of credit when you need it in the future plus you start becoming more responsible with your money.\n\n>And most importantly are their any hidden charges \n\nNope. If any, there are some charges if you take EMI, like 199rs plus GST when you opt for emi while transacting.",

Your debt to income ratio might be flagging the red flag.\n\n>Is it wise to get a yearly paid card?? Tata neu is offering me one year free card\n\nIf you can generate benefits worth more than the fee of the card, there is no harm in getting a paid card. Not every best thing comes free of cost, sometimes we need to pay for that. If you have a banking relationship with HDFC, try to get a card through your relationship manager. Try to get a core card first from HDFC like Millennia or Regalia Gold if your aim is to get good cards like Dinners club black of Infinia in future otherwise if you just need some cashback Swiggy one is good.",

      ">i believe only previously rejected banks are rejecting, new banks are ready to give big credit.\n\nIf that's the thing, you might be applying before completing the cooling period, each bank has it's policy of a cooldown between two applications it's usually 90 to 180 days. \n\n>Also if my relation with icici are good still my amazon icici card is getting rejected, why is that?\n\nICICI works in mysterious ways. I have one year old ICICI account, in one year they have offered me home loan, personal loan and loan against mutual funds but they never offered me credit card and whenever I applied for any card they rejected instantly, kinda funny that they can give me loans in range of 30-40Lakhs but can't even give me a credit card with 50K limit. \n\n Amazon card is notorious for rejection. They can reject the application without any reason, do one thing visit the branch with your ITR and ask for any LTF card, no matter whether it's ICICI platinum or Emerald, add the card on Amazon and do some shopping, next time you should get Amazon pay on shared limit with existing ICICI cards. IMO ICICI cards don't justify their fees. \n\nYour current strategy should be getting a credit card. No matter how poor it's reward rate is. You can get better cards letter.",

Or you're saying I should contact the nbfcs directly.\n\nAlso small update, I can only access this report through cred because I have logged in with the mobile number he used. Thankfully, all my bank accounts and Pan are linked to other number through which I was able to access my credit report.

If yes then its good sign for you because he is responsible and we can also assume that this is some kind of mistake from bank or credit bureau.\n\n\nNow one thing you can do is if he used your pan number and registered number then there are chances that he used your details to take loan but again I think its not possible because now days all loans required OTP before the disbursement also they make sure that money is credited into your account, according to pan number name. \n\n\nalso to remove all 11 account from all credit bureau you will be required to drop mail so they can remove. i would suggest start doing asap in case they dont you can reach out to rbi ombudsman.",

So those aren't reflected in my pan credit report. I used gpay as you said, with the mobile number linked to my pan then only the ones that I am using are showing.\nWhen I use the other number which was used by him I get all of those 11 accounts. And I think this number was also not linked to his pan because I have not received any otps as of such. As we can see in the credit report, the personal details for that account and such all of them were his details, like his name, pan, aadhar and mobile number. So he just used my name and number to register for that apps. And for applying kyc he used his pan so all these got linked to my number. I think this is the case."

      "700 above is not a good score. You need 750+\n\nYou can surely do that via Slice but it's better if you take a FD backed card like IDFC WoW since that would teach you more how about credit cards while also building your credit score. Many banks approve cards easily if you have any bank's existing card",

    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1db2eb0/how_i_escaped_the_credit_card_debt_trap_in_2015/",
    "created_utc": "2024-06-08",
    "selftext": "Back in 2015, I found myself in a vicious cycle of credit card debt, and I wanted to share my story in hopes it might help someone in a similar situation.\n\n**The Beginning of the Debt Trap**\n\nMy journey into debt started with impulse purchases and a lack of understanding about my credit limit relative to my income. I made the classic mistake of only paying the minimum amount due each month, not realizing how quickly interest was compounding and how it was setting me up for financial disaster.\n\n**Living with Debt**\n\nLiving with the constant stress of mounting debt was incredibly difficult. Every basic expenditure became a source of anxiety. I was always nervous about calls from recovery agents and often found myself dodging their calls. It felt like I was trapped in a never-ending cycle with no way out.\n\n**The Turning Point**\n\nAfter struggling for over a year, I finally decided to call the bank and request some extra time to make payments. It was during this period that I realized I could take a personal loan to pay off the credit card debt. This was a game-changer for me. I took a personal loan of about 1.3 lacs INR with a repayment tenure of 18 months. The interest rate on the personal loan was significantly lower than the credit card interest rate, making the repayments much more manageable.\n\n**The Road to Recovery**\n\nPaying off the credit card debt brought an immense sense of relief and happiness. I knew I could handle the personal loan repayments without any problem. After 18 months, I felt over the moon having cleared the debt. However, my CIBIL score had taken a major hit and was around 500.\n\nTo rebuild my credit score, I took a Slice credit card with a modest limit of about 5000 INR and used it responsibly. Slowly but surely, my credit score began to improve. Today, my CIBIL score is around 795, and I have access to almost any credit card I want. This journey from financial despair to stability has been incredibly rewarding.\n\n**Lessons Learned and Advice**\n\nFrom this experience, I learned several important lessons:\n\n1. **Never Overspend on a Credit Card**: Always be mindful of your spending and ensure it aligns with your ability to repay the full bill each month.\n2. **Pay the Total Bill Due**: Avoid paying just the minimum amount to prevent falling into a debt trap.\n3. **Consider Personal Loans for Debt Repayment**: If you're struggling with credit card debt, a personal loan can be a much cheaper option due to its lower interest rates.\n4. **Don't Panic**: It’s crucial to stay calm, make a plan, and follow through with it. Financial stress can be overwhelming, but a structured approach can help you regain control.\n\nIf you're currently facing a similar situation, know that it's possible to overcome it with the right strategies and mindset. Take it one step at a time, seek help when needed, and stay disciplined in your financial practices.\n\n**AMA too. Let's spread more awareness around CC debt traps and how to escape them if you're caught in one.**",

Why shouldn't someone who already has a card linked with Apple Pay be allowed to use it regardless of their nationality? Indians can use apple pay if they have a card that supports Apple Pay.",

And a wallet app that doesn't support UPI is basically useless in India."

But again I was never able to purchase anything of price more than 10K.\n\n\n\n\nI've applied to some other cards from ICICI and got 1L limit, which is much more appropriate to my income and my credit score. My CIBIl has always been in 750-800 range (currently 780). \nDuring the first year of card, I applied for CL increase, gave all the documentation and then got rejected due to \"internal policies\", and then have to wait for three months. Waited three months, applied again, denied again. REPEAT. I've raised request to nodal officers as well but to no avail.\n\n\n\n\nSo what's the best way to increase it.

They then asked me to send proof of income (payslips, bank statements etc), which I did. Then they said the request would be processed within 3 weeks (not sure why they need so much time)\n\nAfter not getting any further communication within the promised date, I thought I’d  need to follow up again and opened the SBI app to take a screenshot. \nSurprisingly the limit was already increased but there was zero notification. Present limit is around 3L, still not as much as my other cards but way better than the initial 20k. \n\nSo maybe continuously email them asking for a CL increase.",

Instead of giving me an upgrade offer, they're even denying my requests.\n\nWhat breaks my heart even more is that my friend who earns the same as me applied to this card after me, and got a 1 Lakh limit.\n\n\nI even asked the nodal officer what they expect me to do to fit into their policies. Should I keep the total usage under 30%, should I spend as much as I can while prepaying most of it to keep it under 30%, should I keep my utilisation as high as possible or should I just stop using this card for some while.\nBut all I got was the same pre-written generic answers.",

    "selftext": "I've noticed that many people don't like the Pixel card, but I feel differently, so let's explore whether it could be beneficial for you too.\n\nIn this discussion, I will cover the HDFC Pixel Play card (the Pixel Go is similar, with the exception of the 5% and 3% categories).\n\n• Category - Cashback\n• Select Visa + Rupay version for best optimization. (Visa physical and Rupay Virtual)\n\n💳 1) Joining/Annual fees - Offered Lifetime free from 1st Dec 2024.\n• Applications can only be submitted via the Payzapp app and are typically approved with ease.\n\n 🎁 2) Cashback Structure \n     A} 5 percent Cashback on any 2 packs you choose i.e 4 merchants (listed below).\n1st pack ] Dining & Entertainment – Bookmyshow & Zomato.\n2nd pack ] Travel – MakeMyTrip & Uber.\n3rd pack ] Grocery – Blinkit & Reliance Smart Bazaar.\n4th pack ] Electronics Category – Croma & Reliance Digital.\n5th pack ] Fashion Category – Nykaa & Myntra.\n\nB} 5 percent Cashback on the Smartbuy platform - accessible through the Shop segment of the Payzapp app or directly via the Smartbuy website.\nSmartBuy under categories IGP, Flights, Hotels, Bus, Rail, Instant Vouchers, Apple Imagine Tresor. Yes on train bookings it gives 5 percent cashback. (Even Regalia Gold doesn't provide 5 percent value back on train bookings.)\n\nC} 3 percent cashback on any one e-commerce platform - Amazon, Flipkart, or Payzapp.\n\nD} Get 10 percent cashback on food and dining, applicable via direct scan and pay using UPI on the credit card (this is an introductory offer and might be discontinued later, but it's definitely the best feature among all).\nAdditionally, while Payzapp highlights food and dining, the terms and conditions only mention dining; I have successfully received cashback in the food category as well.\n\nE} 1 percent cashback offered on all other UPI transactions. Transactions that are not eligible for cashback include fuel purchases, wallet transactions, rent payments, government-related transactions, and EMI payments. Unlike Tata Neu, this option is not restricted to PayZapp and can be utilized through other applications.\nThe best choice would be the Kiwi app, as it also provides an additional cashback of 0.2 to 1.5 percent or super money. This is the optimal combination if you do not possess a Kiwi credit card. (I do not have a Kiwi card because it is unable to fetch my CIBIL score; I'm not sure why.)\n\nF} 1% unlimited cashback on other expenses. Categories excluded are same as above.\n\n🔴 3) Cashpoint capping and Validity  \nAll cashback is provided in the form of Cashpoints.\n1 Cashpoint = 1 rupees. A minimum of 1000 Cashpoints is required to redeem. (No redemption fee applies)  \nCapping limits (applicable each calendar month)  \nCategory A - 500 Cashpoints across a total of 4 merchants.  \nCategory B - 500 Cashpoints throughout smartbuy (SB)  \nCategory C - 500 Cashpoints any one e-commerce\nCategory D - 500 Cashpoints, but each transaction is capped at 250.  \nCategory E - 500 Cashpoints across UPI.  \nCategory F - Unlimited  \n• All Cashpoints remain valid for 2 years from the date they are credited.\n\n⛽ 4) Waiver on fuel surcharge - 1 percent for transactions ranging from 400 to 5000, capped at 250rs per statement cycle.  \n\n• No milestone rewards or lounge access provided.\n\nHere are two key points to remember:  \nFirst, if you hold any other HDFC card, you’ll need to divide the credit limit and transfer it to your Pixel card from the existing HDFC card.  \nSecond, the PayZapp support team is not very helpful.  \nEven for straightforward issues, their response time can take up to two days, and sometimes they don’t reply at all, although I haven't encountered that situation; I got to know this from the Technofino community.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the simplicity of obtaining this card and the fact that it's a lifetime free card, it is an excellent choice for beginners or even for Pros if their needs align with the following 3 points: \n\n1st) A 10% cashback on food and dining transactions made directly via UPI—ideal for those who frequent restaurants that are not associated with popular dining platforms like Easydiner or Swiggy Dinout (yes, I've even received 10% cashpoints at a samosa and litti shop when the merchant utilized the food MCC). \n\n2nd) A 5% cashback on train bookings through SB (only premium cards or IRCTC co-branded cards offer this level of rewards on train bookings). \n\n3rd) UPI transactions if you don't possess a Kiwi card. By using the Kiwi app with the Pixel card, you can earn an overall cashback ranging from 1.2% to 2.5%. (I dislike the Tata Neu card because it's restricted to the Tata Neu app, and their Neu Coin system is shit and the app is laggy.)\n\nPersonal experience:  \nI received this card on March 19, 2025, and in the 12 days since then, I have earned 762 Cashpoints from approximately 14,000 in spending. This shows the rewards rate of approx 5.4 percent. \nI use this card to book train tickets, pay for food and dining, and conduct UPI transactions, and given that it’s a lifetime free card, I find this rate to be quite impressive. \n\nWhile many people dislike this card, it has been offering me excellent cashback, so ultimately, my advice would be to refrain from choosing a card based solely on others' opinion. firstly analyse your spends and determine which card would be most beneficial for YOUR SPENDS.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Neo might be okay to hold for the offers it gives and the SBI card might be okay if you are actually able to break even.

I mailed Kiwi and they told me it was due to their internal policies. On pressing, they refused to share more due to security reasons.\n\nI have 5 other credit cards with CIBIL score of 784. Never faced rejection before this as I always go through eligibility. Credit age is just under 5 years.\n\nTrying to understand the criteria here. People who have got the card, did you get it as one of your first cards? Did anyone get it with salary range under 10LPA? \n\nI do not have any card with Yes Bank and I live in a Tier 1 city where they operate. Appreciate any help. ",

I hope others can benefit from it and provide any suggestions if any\n\nmy strategy where I don’t over optimise.\n\n- Yes bank kiwi credit card 2% on upi\n\n- Amex travel - 10k amazon voucher each month and use that on groceries and utility. Also, pay nps and tax payments\n\n- amex gold for fuel on hp pumps and vouchers of brands when i do offline or online shopping, give 5X mr points\n\n- sbi cashback, wherever i cant use vouchers by amex gyftr or axis gyftr\n\n- axis atlas for all offline transactions and pos machine swipes. Also, buy vouchers from axis gyftr as i get good discount on vouchers first and then also get 7.2% on discounted price so roughly 9-10% crazy deal. Book all indigo flights using atlas and end up with 18% return in form of accor. I find accor has decent properties and are little economical as compared to marriott redemption for amex\n\n- recently added hsbc live+ for blinkit, zepto, swiggy, zomato, eatsure, swish, reliance mart and all grocerries stores. Paying at any cafe also gives 10% but it is capped at 1000. So i can spend only 10k each month to get 1k back. After 10k i shift back to atlas or amex\n\n- have been buying amazon vouchers and using them everywhere possible. Also, you can buy amazon vouchers on amazon using sbi cashback and you ll get 5% cashback\n\nHave few more ltf cards only for bank offers which i use rarely. Let me know if i can add something or can switch to optimise more. \n\nThanks :)",

Fast forward to now, I've 8 credit cards.\n\nICICI platinum (LTF Ofcourse)is still there as it's my first ever cc\n\nICICI HPCL (500+)  is for petrol. I am able to extract more value in a year than it's annual fees. Also for first year fee waived off after 1.5L spend.\n\nI got Diners Club Privilege (LTF) because it was available as LTF and I didn't have any HDFC card, and also has BOGO upto 250 rs twice a month on weekends (got rejected for millennia/regalia earlier)\n\nIDFC First Wealth (LTF) gives upto 250 Rs off (BOGO) on Movies. Earlier when my spends were from this card, it gave 2 lounge access / 2 spa access per quarter which is USP of this card IMO.\n\nI had got Altura+ (LTF) as my 2nd credit card because again it was LTF and kept it just for AU Bank offers (later regretted not getting AU Ixigo)\n\nAxis MyZone (LTF) was yet another card I got just for Axis Bank offers. Earlier also had no spend criteria lounge access. Literally zero benefit now (Apart from some Swiggy discounts)\n\nI got the Adani ICICI (FYF) from Adani lounge at Mumbai airport because it was being offered FYF. Additionally it has some decent benefits IMO. It offers discounts on Railway bookings, Gas/Electricity payment etc. Also has 2 lounge access per quarter (business class lounge at Adani lounges) Might continue/close this card from next year.\n\nFinally I added a premium credit card to my portfolio as I was scrolling through Axis Open app and saw that I have Axis Atlas (5k+) pre approved. Got the digital card instantly. Now I try to spend as far as possible from this card. Specially flight bookings. Also had to pay hotel bill around 1L so got this card just in time for that.\n\nThen I have 2 debit cards. HDFC millennia (also offers 1 lounge/qtr on 5k spend, better criteria than millennia CC)\n\nAnd then I have the GOAT debit card. The SBI Visa Platinum. This is the only card which gives 2 lounge access per quarter without spend criteria, without maintenance charge. And also has access to any lounge I have ever been to (BLR 080 included)\n\nDuring these two years I tried to get many other cards but got rejected regardless of my CIBIL score and other things. These include Scapia, Millennia, Kiwi, POP Club, IndusInd Legend/Tiger, HSBC Live+ etc.\n\nWhat card should I try getting next? I'll be applying after 5 months from now \nAlso any card to discard?\n\n",

IMO upgrade to AU IXIGO or cancel it outright.\n\nCards to add (if possible): Any Amex card of choice (reward point game with Amex is really good), Infinia or DCB Metal upgrade from current HDFC DCB and any RuPay card like HDFC Tata Neu Infinity or Kiwi CC (if you can apply again).\n\nScapia is better than AU IXIGO IMO, but if IXIGO is easier to get because of the existing card, you may go for that since Scapia is EXTREMELY hard to get.",

From what I've heard, even after closing the card one can't apply for another AU.\n\nDefinitely thinking of Amex.

      "You already have Amazon Pay ICICI and HDFC Swiggy which should be good enough for online cashback and great cashback cards. You still feel you need SBI cashback you could try for that and close HDFC Swiggy if it is not LTF. Or HSBC Live+ for offline shopping (is a paid card). \n\nFor lounge without any spend criteria IndusInd Tiger is good and LTF — 8 domestic + 2 international per year. \n\nYou know the cards you are not using. If they are not LTF close them—no brainer. If they are LTF you could keep them but make sure you manage carefully — the chances of missing a small payment are huge if you have too many cards. As you build your career you will build CIBIL score too. You need just one or two cards to build a score so you can safely close the cards you don’t use. \n\nDon’t worry about good point system for future benefits. Given the devaluations, new card launches, etc. what’s good now may be useless 5 years down the line. Amex points may still hold value though, but your spends may make it a poor choice given their relatively higher fees. \n\nFor example I guess you don’t use Kotak IOCL because fuel isn’t a spend category. If that’s the case and the card is paid, close it. If it’s LTF keep it for the future if you feel like. I myself use my Kotak IOCL for fuel and while it’s not the best fuel card it works fine, had no issue with points being added after purchase at any IOCL pump, unlike my ICICI HPCL Super Saver where points were never added and I had to ask customer service every time. \n\nAnd be a bit careful about your mum using your cards for her business. Small time usage is fine but read about this and don’t do anything that might get one of your cards cancelled.",

      "1576 points are going to translate to nothing of value, so either cash out or leave it.\n\nAlso, there was post earlier today about HDFC converting Regalia to Regalia Gold as they are planning to discontinue it. So, maybe just wait it out?",
      "Out of the following cards you have regalia gold is the most premium one.  I guess you should reconsider your decision if its LTF",
      "Also there’s no way to upgrade it to infinia unless you meet their income or spend criteria",
      "This card is regalia gold only was converted to gold long time ago",
      "It seems like a premium one but on paper it is not that rewarding compared to other cards",
      "yeah thats also true & if you dont want super premium hdfc cards you can close this"

    "selftext": "I had a secured IDFC Wow and a Kotak League Rupay. I had got these for Lounge and UPI respectively and it was convenient since I had good family level relationships with both banks. Having used these for 2 years and frequenting this sub I realised I wasn't really earning anything in the name of rewards or cashbacks so I decided to close the secured card (regretting now as it was LTF and Visa Infinite: 1+1 on BMS) and get 2 new cards: SBI Cashback Mastercard and Tata Neu Infinity Rupay.  \nI got the SBI one easily with a 90k+ limit but HDFC only gave me a secured Tata Neu plus. Having had both the cards for a couple of weeks I have learned a few things:   \n1. Tata Neu app is bs - like the worst shopping or finance app I have ever used. Paytm was a thousand times better at both.  \n2. The Neucoin cashback system is too variable and complex. I have yet to understand how can I get the promised 7%.  \n3. Even if I do get the 7% back in neucoins, it means I will have to use them instead of the card the next time which I think technically results to an effective return of 3.5% which is less than what SBI offers. (I have also been using my father's Amazon Pay card with prime and at least I can use the cashback in places I won't actually get the 5% CB, so I am using APay wallet when only losing out on the 1% CB transactions.)  \n 4. Having a co-branded HDFC card is not a good idea if I'm hoping to get a core card anytime soon. (Based on the discussions on this sub).\n\nSince most my transactions are online, I am pretty content with a straight up 5% from SBI. When I do use UPI it's mostly for chai coffee (lot of txns < INR 100) and it is my understanding that Tata Neu CB doesn't apply to them.\n\nFor some reason I could not get the Kiwi card so I am going to keep this card for UPI transactions for a while, but I have decided to close it before the end of the year. Until then I am hoping to find a replacement for a good cashback card for UPI. \n\nIn the near future I am also hoping to get a separate fuel card (fuel spending \\~40-45k p.a.) and enter the Amex world.

Had taken for the Swiggy discount and 1+1 on movie tickets. Swiggy discount is negligible now as rarely order above 500. Movie tickets has also shifted to District app (By Zomato) and 1+1 eligible theatres has reduced.

If you get atlas I'd just keep some rupay card for atlas excluded categories, preferably Tata neu infinity and close the remaining cards.\n\nFor hdfc there isn't any card that will give cashback like millenia, you have to look for cards that will give benefits on travel and to earn the pts you have to route your spends on buying vouchers for the websites you spend on if it's there and if they accept amz pay then you can keep buying 10k inr amz pay gift card and use that to pay. You can also use the card to book flight tickets and hotels which will give even more pts.\n\nAll in all cards that have better reward rate than millenia in hdfc are travel focussed if you wanna reap maximum benefit but you can redeem the pts for vouchers too.\n\nSo you buy vouchers for your spends from smartbuy and redeem the pts for vouchers."

Also I pay health insurance, car insurance etc from this card annually. When on official travel, I use this for hotel bill payment and get it reimbursed from office. Have used for international expenses once or twice. I also use this for lounge access when needed at airport. Not a big fan though.\n\nICICI Amazon Pay LTF: Used on Amazon and Bill payments on Amazon like Airtel Internet, electricity bills. Also used for Amazon fresh grocery\n\nAll ICICI cards hold a shared limit of 15 L.\nTypical monthly spend around 50K . Goes up when there are occasional spends.\n\nHDFC : Indian oil Rupay LTF : used earlier for fuel, up until recently used for UPI \n\nHDFC Tata Neu infinity Rupay: FYF : got this last week. Have switched UPI spend to this. I’m not much into TATA eco system.  Got this for lounge access and hoping to hit 3L annual spend, if not I may cancel this next year.\n\nAll HDFC cards hold shared limit of 180,000. Typical monthly spend have been 4 ~ 8k\n\nSBI Cashback card VISA: used for non Amazon online spends. Mostly DMart online, Zepto , Zomato etc. Got about 12k cashback in last year. Recently started using Park+ fuel vouchers. Typical monthly spend have been 12K. Used for medplus online, OTT monthly subscriptions etc. Limit 150,000\n\nI’ve recently applied for Kiwi card and it’s about to be issued. Expecting this by next week. \n\nCIBIL score : 800+\n\nMy primary banking relationship is with ICICI. For some reason, all card upgrade offers that were showing up earlier are no longer showing up.  But RM is offering Emerald ( regular, not private metal) on 12K /year fee basis. I’m asking for LTF.\n\nHDFC wasn’t offering any upgrades and recently learned that when you hold contended card like Indian oil, no upgrades are offered.  \n\nI’ve not used iShop or smart buy yet. Recently learned from this community that there is some value.\n\nWhat cards I should target next? I’m thinking AU Ixigo for international travel which I may take up with in this year. Also, anything to ditch? \n",

    "comments": [
      "The decision to use regalia or any other cards, depend a lot on your spend categories. Would suggest you to first understand your spend categories.",
      "When it comes to closing a credit card, it’s important to make a thoughtful decision based on your spending patterns and usage. Avoid choosing a card out of FOMO; instead, select a card that aligns with your lifestyle and offers benefits that truly suit your needs. This way, you’ll get the most value from it rather than the other way around.\n\nIt’s important to note that simply requesting a card to be converted to LTF (Lifetime Free) may not be granted easily. Typically, this requires either a strong relationship with the bank or demonstrating significant usage of your Regalia Gold card. Additionally, HDFC markets the Regalia Gold as a sub-premium category card, and they aim to ensure value from the card as well. \n\nA more effective approach would be to show consistent and high usage of the card, ideally reaching or exceeding the threshold for an annual fee waiver(in a short time preferable). Afterward, you could request a conversion to LTF. However, please keep in mind that even in such cases, HDFC may still perform thorough scrutiny before approving the request.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, I've started my CC journey late Oct 2024. Thanks for letting me know about all the information!!!\n\nSo, Here's my journey!\n\n- **Applied (in order):** Kiwi YesB, IDFC Wow, Amazon ICICI, SBI Cashback, AU Ixigo, Airtel Axis, RBL Shoprite, IndusIND Tiger, SBI Platinum Debit, Uni Gold X, Axis Neo.\n\n- **Approved:** IDFC Wow Visa LTF + Rupay Virtual 200/yr FYF (FD max limit), SBI Cashback (20k) - 999/yr, RBL Shoprite LTF (25k), SBI Platinum Debit 300/yr.\n\n### My experience with Credit Score Agencies:\n\n- Closing off overdraft against FD gave me a boost of 64 points immediately (692 -> 756), it was my only credit product I had, running since 3 years since I was a student back then. It was a flexi loan, so no EMI = no default possible, was just interest at 1% above FD.\n\n- Multiple enquiries does not really cost much, in my experience - 1 point drop every 2 enquiries. This has been my experience, maybe it differ for other ppl.\n\n### My experience with my approved CCs:\n\n1. IDFC Wow:\n\n  - **IDFC App:** Really helpful, every details is clearly given, easy dispute for old transactions, **MCC code is clearly given of each and every txn** (I really like this feature - helps for other card spend criterias too).\n\n  - **IDFC Wow Visa:** Good discounts on Flipkart Mobile phones, used for 2-3k off on 20-25k segment twice. This is other than reward points which is 0.67% in addition.\n\n  - **IDFC Wow Rupay:** Zomato for limited period have flat 15% off over 3k+ bill  upto Rs1200, used that multiple times (almost once or twice every month). I got this as FYF and 200/yr after, mostly only for UPI or zomato, might not close as the benefit of viewing MCC codes is actually a plus for me. Found a lot of juice shops have groccery MCC which I can utilize with my other card.\n\n  - Cons: Rs99+gst redemption fees (468 points go in vain), so haven't yet redeem anything till now, good thing points never expire.\n\n2. SBI Cashback:\n\n  - No Nonsense card, straight 5% off (I see effective ~4.81% because of rounding off maybe). Cashback visible within 2-4 days as soon as txn is settled.\n\n  - Sadly got only 20k limit. For big ticket purchases I generally mix with rest of amount to Amazon Shopping Voucher from IDFC Poshvine (3% off).\n\n  - **SBI Card App:** is little shit. My card is currently in my hometown, can't swipe and get 1% sadly for now, Tap n Pay doesn't work in SBI Card App (says server down). Although Scan n Pay worked in one of the restaurant (BharatQR) making me eligible for 5% back on offline.\n\n3. RBL Shoprite:\n\n  - Just issued, already knew MCC of frequent juice shops & dmart using my previous txn on IDFC Wow. 5% off on groccery offline / upi.\n\n  - Con: Previous txn rewards not visible, don't know when it is processed.\n\n  - Con: Same problem with IDFC Wow, Rs99+gst for redemption, and points expire in 2 years. But hey, its better than 1% I'd be getting using SBI CB in offline setting.\n\n### My current strategy\n\n1. Online / BharatQR (rare) / McDonalds online order on dinein: SBI CB (5%).\n2. Offline Grocery / Juice Shops: RBL Shoprite via UPI (5%).\n3. Limit exhausted: IDFC Wow - via poshvine GV or directly (0.67% swipe|upi>2k or 0.16% on upi<2k).\n4. Lounge - SBI Platinum DC (2/quater).\n\n5. Dipping\n  - IDFC Poshvine -> AmazonPay Voucher (1%) -> Uber (5%)\n    - Nowadays I use namma yatri in blr or I already get 17% off on Uber iykyk.\n  - IDFC Poshvine -> Amazon Shopping Voucher (3%) partial pay possible, rest via other CC\n  - Any Rupay -> Zomato Dining (15%)\n\n6. Bill Pay\n  - IndMoney with UPI, I was getting 0.3% consistently back.\n  - Might switch to Mobikwik this month, getting Rs350 cb as first time user for first payment and fullpay consecutively, later 1% is back as supercash (which can be used as 5% of utility payments / mobile recharges - Axis Neo alternative lol). Also, Mobikwik allows SBI DC as payment method, which gives 0.25% back similar to the INDMoney anyway.\n\n### MCC Codes\n\nHere's the list of MCC Codes I found using my IDFC card (will keep updating):\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSnTCMEnNfDA4nXwWu6S67y5CHXDldXvvaejv7Uai-ZT5CWcDJqR4pUru8w0s1sEGoBVOt4B7dCUyhJ/pubhtml\n\nThanks again, will keep you posted!

So, here's my effort to compile the top credit cards for each category.\n\n**Food & Groceries**\n\n* Food: HSBC Live+ for 10% cashback for offline dining payment. Infinia for 16.25% for Swiggy/Zomato vouchers. Special mention: Indusind Eazydiner Platinum/Signature card for 20%/25% up to 500/1000 off if you have booked an appointment via Eazydiner. There are other cards which will give up to 40% across Zomato, Swiggy, Easydiner etc, but minimum amount is more than 2500.\n* Groceries: HSBC Live+ for 10% cashback for offline & online groceries payment. 10% is even applicable on Dmart, Lulu, SPAR etc. Infinia for 16.25% using vouchers.\n\nTip: Make sure to apply for HSBC Live+ via CashKaro. You get 2200 cashback within 3 months which is basically 2 years free. I have personally done this, so its verified. You can do the same for other credit cards like SBI CB etc. Alternatives for CashKaro are Gromo, ZET partner etc for many other credit cards to get cashback for applying for a credit card.\n\n**Travel**\n\n* Book a Cab: ICICI Emerald Private/Infinia for 18%/15% + 5% using Apay Vouchers(for Uber).\n* Rent a Cab: Infinia for 16.25% if you book ZoomCar via gyft\n* Buy a Car: Axis Magnus with Burgundy. For 10L car, you can get 12%. Will be more if you use the points effectively.\n* Book Train Ticket: Infinia - 10% using Smartbuy.\n* Book Flight Ticket: Infinia - 16.5% using Smartbuy. Special mention: Amex Platinum Charge - 20% in Air India if you use points smartly.\n* Book Hotels: Infinia - Infinia - 33% using Samrtbuy. ICICI Emerald Private - 36% using iShop.\n\n**Bill Payments**\n\n* Utility Bill Payments: ICICI Emerald Private/Infinia for 18%/13% for paying via Apay Vouchers wherever necessary. Special Mention: Airtel Axis Bank for 25% cashback. But the monthly limit is pretty low.\n* QR Payment: Yes Bank Kiwi for 2-5% based on milestone.\n* Tax Payment: HDFC Biz Metal for 15%\n\n**Generic Payments**\n\n* Any Online Transaction: SBI cashback for 5%\n* Any Offline Transaction: Axis Atlas for 4-10%\n* Any International Online Transaction: Yes Bank Marquee for 3.3% (Yes Bank Reserve 3X might provide 3.375%, but need someone to confirm)\n* Any International Offline Transaction: Yes Bank Reserve 3X  for 3.375%\n\n**Shopping**\n\nShopping via Vouchers: Infinia for 16.5% + additional voucher discount. Special mention: Check magic pin for great offers like Puma etc.\n\n**Milestone Related Payments**\n\nMilestone Payments: Amex Trifecta(Platinum Travel, Gold Charge & MRCC) for 10%. You can use these cards for transactions that are mostly excluded like Education fees, Insurance fees, Jewellery, NPS etc.\n\n**Good LTF Credit Cards**\n\n* Tata Neu Infinity for 5% on all Tata products including Tanishq.\n* ICICI Sapphiro for BOGO on Movies up to 500. Special Mention: IDFC Wealth/Axis My Zone for BOGO.\n* HDFC Swiggy Credit Card for 10% off on Swiggy and 5% on most online categories\n* AU Ixigo for zero forex markup fee & lounge access(1 international airport, 16 railway and domestic airport per year.\n* Amazon ICICI for 2% on utility bills.\n\n**Best Debit Cards**\n\n* Axis Burgundy for BOGO on movies/events.\n* HSBC Salary Account Debit Card for 5% cashback up to 2X monthly salary.

Neon membership costs 999+GST. Tata Neu infinity card charges 1499+gst joining and annual fee\nEven with the Kiwi Neon membership, the maximum cashback one can get is 5% kiwi points for spends above 1.5L and 1 kiwi point is equivalent to Rs. 0.25 which effectively makes it Rs.1875 , which is 1.25% returns in rupees terms. \nOn the other hand, Tata Neu offers 1.5% Tataneu coins on upi spends and 1 Neu coin is 1rupee. So, for a spend of 1.5L, this is 2250 Neucoins and is equivalent to 2250 rupees,  which is still 1.5% returns in rupees terms. \nIs this calculation correct?\nAre there any other cards which are better in terms of rewards and cashback.\nAre there any other ways to spend these reward points to maximize benefits?\n",

But, there are more hassle-free Rupay cards like BoB Snapdeal which gives 1% cashback on UPI payments as statement credit.\n\nAs for Neu Infinity, the card is great but the obvious caveat being that you get the cashback as Neu coins. So, you have to spend those on Tata products like big basket, Chroma, Titan eye+, etc. I don't know how much you spend on UPI but if you use Tata services, then it's a no brainer.\n\nOtherwise, Kiwi is better as it's less complicated (Neu coins are earned in a split manner which get credited in two different statements and people often get confused about the Neu pass rewards and Neu card rewards)",
      "Those who are not getting Neu card, KIWI is best !!",
      "I use Kiwi and I I’ve used Neu Infinity.Kiwi rewards are straight forward and instant. Neu is split between the Neu app and some come in statement and you’re tied into Tata’s ecosystem.\n\nNeon membership is still FYF if you have referral."

There’s no way to edit the address, no option to fill it correctly, and absolutely no way to contact customer support—no chat, no helpline, nothing. It’s as if once you're stuck, you're on your own.\n\nWith this experience, I am seriously reconsidering my decision to go for Kiwi. If their support is this bad during onboarding, I can’t imagine what would happen if there’s an issue with transactions, billing, or fraud in the future.

But somehow, their **grievance team is replying to my emails** with vague responses like *\"internal policies.\"* If Yes Bank has no record, then how is Kiwi even partnered with them? This **seems like a scam!**\n\n# ⚠️ RBI Guidelines Violated\n\n📌 **As per RBI Circular DBOD.No.Leg.BC.65/09.07.005/2006-07 dated March 6, 2007, Point 5 clearly states:**\n\n*\"In case of all categories of loans irrespective of any threshold limits, including credit card applications, banks / FIs should convey in writing the main reason / reasons which, in the opinion of the bank / FI have led to rejection of the loan applications.\"*\n\n📌 **Neither Kiwi nor Yes Bank** is following these RBI-mandated guidelines! They **keep avoiding the issue** with vague responses.  \n📌 If **Yes Bank’s Nodal Officer** also fails to provide a proper explanation, I will **file a formal complaint with RBI.**\n\n# 🔥 User Complaints & Hidden Comments\n\n📌 **Many users** have reported **similar issues** on Kiwi’s **Instagram comments**, but Kiwi is **hiding them to cover up their mistakes**!  \n📌 Their customer support is **non-existent** – no responses, no resolution.\n\n# 🚨 Time for an Investigation!\n\nKiwi & Yes Bank’s **malpractices must be reviewed by RBI & NPCI!** Their **free RuPay credit card** is misleading, with **no real support** for customers.\n\n📢 **Avoid such fraudulent free credit cards!** Share your experiences & warn others!",

Go for it, and hope you get clarity and the card you seem to so desperately seek. I would have given up long ago — not worth all the trouble for Rs 200 or so cashback in a month. \n\nBut it is NOT A SCAM! It’s a very good credit card which is regarded as the best UPI scan and pay credit card in India today (by members of this very sub)! \n\nCalling the card/service a scam shows your desperation in a very poor light.",

Flipkart Axis (LTF/VISA)\n\nNeeded one **RuPay for UPI** and got TataNue Plus (LTF) last December. Thought one HDFC in arsenal would be good. For UPI, I use BHIM. **Now the concerns are:**\n\n1. Its co-branded, so may not be eligible for instant discount offers of HDFC card (please confirm).\n\n2. Using UPI for fuel to avoid surcharge (GST) and time to swipe card. Am I doing it right?\n\n3. As I use BHIM, last month got only 23 Nuecoin for 19k UPI spend. Using TataNue app will fetch more coin I guess. But this month, in some spends through TataNue app, coins are not consistent/straight forward, unlike FK/aPay cards.\n\n4. Not in Tata ecosystem. So Nuecoins are not that beneficial like AmazonPay balance for me.\n\n**Please give insight for my above queries. Will be highly grateful brothers and sirs.** \n\nAlso, have some thought on other cards:\n\na. Airtel Axis - Do the offer to select RuPay? b. Indusind - They do call me regularly. LTF. But which one to choose? c. Kiwi - Some suggestions in this forum.\n\n**In comparison to TataNue Plus, which of the above give better cashback for normal UPI transaction from BHIM, not their own app?**  ",
    "comments": [
      "Kiwi (but i guess you must use kiwi app)",
      "1) HDFC hardly offers instant discount anywhere. But if they do, the neu cards work there\n\n2) Fuel surcharge is levied on UPI payment by credit card on petrol pumps. I had Baroda’s HPCL energie and once i used that for fuel payment by mistake via UPI and I was charged fuel surcharge and it wasn’t reversed. It has to be swipe transaction only for fuel surcharge waiver. Tata neu offers a 1% fuel surcharge waiver\n\n3) When you do UPI from tata neu app, you get 0.5% neu coins in the app and 0.5% neu coins will come in the credit card statement. (For plus variant)\n\n4) For rupay, tata Neu infinity is the best card. Plus is ok but not that great. Kiwi is the best for your use case. AU spont has a 1% reward rate on UPI. I don’t know any others that are above 1%.\n\nDefinitely upgrade to Neu infinity if you can. It was being offered LTF sometime back not sure if its still LTF. I have it as a paid card. I’ve already crossed the fee waiver on it but it’s absolutely worth the AMC as well. You can buy amazon vouchers upto 50k pm from the neu app with a 5% CB and use that at almost all online websites & it gives you a 1.5% reward rate offline which is the highest reward rate in terms of CB in the industry.",
      "Airtel axis do have rupay variant. I’m also looking to replace Neu infinity with some other rupay card(s)",
      "Wow. Thanks for writing so detailed comment. Now, after searching for last night, I have started liking Tata Nue a little more.\n\n1. On fuel UPI spend, it doesn't surcharge. Kiwi does. Indusind Does. That's an advantage.\n\n2. As you've said nue cards are eligible for instant HDFC discounts, I am relieved to have one HDFC with me. Also 5% back for chroma and other tata sites, which may be availed in future since I got this.\n\n3. During application Airtel is offering only Mastercard variant, not Rupay. So its out of question now.\n\nWill pursue HDFC for infinity update after 1 year maybe.",

Why did you apply for Swiggy when you anyhow wanted to take hsbc live + ? \n\n2. For 2-3k spends on fuel, you don't need a dedicated fuel card bro . \n\n3. Skip tata neu infinity, you are anyhow getting kiwi for UPI and you can take MRCC for insurance, fuel  as well as offline spends. \n\n4. Take MRCC , buy apay vouchers and stock it. When insurance payment comes ( quarterly or monthly or annual ) pay it off with the apay balance. Also you can do fuel via MRCC , there is a trick. \n\n5. Do you really need axis airtel ? You can get the utilities done via amex too. If you have airtel broadband, definitely go for axis airtel. I know you can get 10% back for your eb and gas bill every month but you have Swiggy and you are also getting hsbc live +, so the other 10% back for food delivery from axis airtel would be wasted. \n\n6.

In MRCc I saw that the utility fuel and insurance are excluded. Is that not?\n4. I thought that if I don't meet the spend of 4 * 1.5k or 20k. The reward rate is very less. And also for occasional huge spends or offline the rewards are not worth. Am I missing something? Also the renewal fee is very high\n5. Only reason for airtel axis is 10% utility. Need to think before applying.\n6. No account.\n\nAm I taking too much cards. Will it affect anything? I am planning to close the sbi and IndusInd though",

      "Go for SBI BPCL then axis don't have that kind of rewards",
      "1. id suggest having 1 card bro , no use having multiple cards for same category, its just added headache to track. If you ask me, HSBC live + seems like the best option for your spends.\n\n2. Understood, but if you do take MRCC, you can get same 4% cb through park + . If not, then yes , keep the card.\n\n3. If you take MRCC, you can load up on apay vouchers like i mentioned and pay for insurance.  If not, then yes, Infinity makes sense. But the FYF component is not good considering you might only use it for insurance spends.\n\n4. You can basically buy apay vouchers and stock them in your amazon pay balance for eventualy paying off insurance ( Gets you base and milestone rewards this way) or use it via park + for petrol making sure you transact for 1500 or 2000 each time . As long as you hit 1.5L annual spends on MRCC, you hit the fee waiver AND you can clock around 5% returns if you redeem the MR for apay vouchers. If you redeem for Tanisq or Taj or Airmiles or Marriot, return rate goes up. Amex is all about Milestones, hit them and you are good. Doesnt matter offline or Online. Milestone + 1.5L or Milestone + 2.4L total spends, gets you 5% and 4% return rate.\n\n5. Agreed. Again, if not taking MRCC, go this route.\n\n6. Gotcha. You can get one if you need it. ITs a bonus of that card.\n\n  \nId say no issue in taking too many cards other than it becoming a headache to handle and optimize thats all. Thats the reason i am suggesting MRCC cause it sort of solves the issue of 3 cards in one. Earlier SBI CB could do the same role as mrcc but they patched it, only beneficial way to buy apay voucher is via park+ or Magic Pin ( if the MCC matches) and that too has a chance of getting patched. meanwhile, with MRCC , you can just directly buy apay voucher from amazon site itself and it will count for base and milestone reward.\n\n  \nIf you are sure you can handle so many cards, go ahead bro. No issues will happen. My only suggestion is to make sure FYF cards dont eat into your returns.",

      "Great will try",
      "Sorry. Can you explain both.\n\nHow to use cashcaro on this aspect.?\n\nFor MRCC. If i spend 1lk in the same month which includes 4 transactions of 1.5k also. I will be getting \n\n1000 for 4 spends + 1000 for 20k milestone + 2000 RP for 1lk. It will be 4k MP which is should be equal to 1300 points only right.\n\nAlso the joing fee of 1500 annual fee of 4500 seems to high. Is there a way to reduce this or make it FTF and LTF?",
      "I mean 1.5L annually bro ..not within just a month. \n\nIf you spend 1.5L totally in a year , you get 5% return. \n\nThe annual fees is waived if you spend 1.5L a year on the card. The joining fees, I provide 2k voucher for successful application for amex so you are good there. \n\nCashkaro works for hsbc live +. If you apply for the card via cashkaro , you get 2200 cashback from cashkaro for successful application. This makes the card essentially 2 years free",

FYI, Founders of Airbnb had also maxxed out their credit cards, but then they got funded as they were in SF and ofc US folks invest way more based on passion, funding scene in India is shit, mfers want to see revenue and shit.\n\nHope you come out stronger in life brother. PS: Better ask money from close friends or relatives than borrow from cards which have the worst interest rate possible.",
      "Getting back on track in life is much more important than any CIBIL score. Bravo 👏. \n\nYou can start with FD backed cards initially for a couple of years say 2 or 3 years. Then think of applying for unsecured cards.",

      "Considering 250 late payments. This is an amazing credit score. It'll come up very slowly.",
      "I suggest you consider obtaining multiple small secured credit cards (backed by fixed deposits). These cards report regularly to credit bureaus, which can help restore your credit score over time. Follow basic tips to improve your score, as this will demonstrate your creditworthiness to banks.\n\nAfter a few months, you can reach out to your bank to request the reactivation of your old card. Make sure to settle all outstanding dues with them and assure them that you won’t repeat past mistakes. This can help rebuild trust. Instead of calling, try visiting the branch in person; they are more likely to assist you directly.\n\nAlso, work on creating stability in your life. Take some time to assess your situation and restart wisely. I hope this advice helps you overcome your financial challenges. If you have more queries, feel free to reach out—I’ll do my best to assist you further.",
      "Yep, you can absolutely restore your CIBIL score—it’s not a permanent breakup, just a rough patch in your relationship with credit. Since you’ve already repaid everything without settling, you’re officially on the redemption arc. Bravo!\n\nNow, about those late payments—they’ll hang around on your report for 7 years like an overdramatic ex (time heals, the score too). But here’s the good news: lenders usually focus on the last 36 months of your credit behaviour. So, if you play it cool and stay disciplined for the next 12–24 months, they’ll probably forgive your past.\n\nTreat your existing cards like royalty. Stick with your Axis and Yes Bank cards. Use them sparingly (keep spending under 30% of the limit) and pay every bill on time, no exceptions. It kinda does feel like your financial life depends on it—because it does. Hold off on new applications and since HDFC blocked your cards earlier, applying for one now might not work in your favour. Plus, too many hard inquiries can hurt your score further. Start small if you want HDFC back. If you’re set on getting back in their good graces, go for a secured card (FD-backed). Think of it as their “trial version” of trusting you again. Bonus: it’ll help improve your credit utilisation ratio.\n\nRemember rebuilding credit is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay consistent and responsible for 12–24 months, and you’ll be back in the good books sooner than you think. Good luck, champ!",

    "selftext": "Man, I'm here to share my credit card journey over the past six months. I waited a long time to post this with how weirdly HSBC ghosts you after the vKYC lol.\n\nI joined this sub in June/July of last year with a very naive question, asking whether my floater card spends would count towards the fee waiver spend for my main card. That single question led me down a whole new path of strategic spending habits, which has made managing my finances so much easier on a moderate salary of 46k per month. I sincerely thank all the card gurus here for opening my eyes to how rewarding a balanced card portfolio can be! \n\nFor all the stupid posts and questions in between, this is still my favorite credit card sub.\n\nComing to my cards. Currently, I hold 6 cards: HDFC Swiggy, Millennia, Amazon Pay ICICI, Kiwi Klick, Airtel Axis, and, finally, the card I wanted the most my HSBC Live+ (I received it randomly on my birthday, truly felt like a gift)\n\nI recently shared my credit card timeline with someone, so I'll just copy-paste it here with a few edits:\n\n1. Swiggy (LTF): Until the middle of last year, I only had a Moneyback+ card. I saw an LTF offer for the Swiggy card on the app, so I applied and got it. Luckily, right after I received it, the settlement to the credit card statement for cashback was announced. I used it extensively until September, until I was offered a Millennia upgrade on my Moneyback+ FYF.\n\n2. Millennia (FYF): I used the Millennia card everywhere except Swiggy until I received the Kiwi card in November. The renewal fee will be waived as spending 1 lakh in a year isn’t too difficult. A very cool anecdote btw: I used my moneyback+ to book 20k+ Coldplay tickets on BMS, luckily my cc got upgraded to Millennia before the billing cycle and they gave me 1000 cashback for it ✨ timing was on my side.\n\n3. Kiwi (LTF): I was on the waitlist, and they eventually offered the card to me through the app. I got it right away, and I mainly use it for UPI payments.\n\n4. Airtel Axis (Paid): I received a notification on the Airtel app saying I was eligible. I applied and got it. Initially, I didn’t plan on activating it since it had an annual fee, but then I saw it had the highest limit of any card I’ve received, so I decided to activate it. With the welcome voucher, it became effectively FYF. I don’t plan on spending the minimum amount required for the renewal fee waiver, but this card easily gives me 500+ cashback per month, which will cover the fee.\n\n5. Amazon Pay CC (LTF): I was offered this card just a week ago via the Amazon app. I took it because it’s free. I don’t have much use for it, but I’ll use it if I make any large transactions (over 20k) on Amazon. Otherwise, Millennia is enough.\n\n6. HSBC Live+ (Paid): This is the only card I’ve ever truly sought out, and it's perfect for my spending habits. I applied for it through the CashKaro app, which will give me 2200 cashback. Then, the card will give me a 1000 voucher if I spend 20k in a month. Essentially, my joining and renewal fees will be covered for almost two years. Also, this card is so clean and beautiful, even the name is on the back.\n\nRegarding cashback, many people rave about the SBI Cashback card, but at this point, it holds no value for me. I already have similar or even better deals with my other cards. Also, getting SBI Cashback card directly means an absolutely shit credit limit, which severely brings down the cashback potential each month.\n\nOkay, that's all folks! Thank you again! Keep helping others and sharing new tricks for maximizing rewards. I'm going to take a break from applying for any more cards for a long time and just enjoy the benefits of the ones I have.",

You can go through it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/Au8o9hoTd8), maybe you might find something useful. Also, I don't want to tell you the benefits of SBI CB but you might like to go for it in future if your spends reach to other websites. HDFC Swiggy is a good one for certain spends and being LTF is a cherry on top but in future you might like to go for SBI CB (hopefully it won't devalue by then). 😬",

I live just 1 km away from a D-Mart, which is super convenient, and I’ve noticed their prices are quite reasonable. However, I also use Big Basket occasionally, especially because you can get 5-10% cashback through Tata Neu.\n\nHere’s what I’m weighing:\n\n* **D-Mart:** If you pay via UPI, you get 2% cashback using KiWi Yes Bank. Even without the extra cashback from Tata Neu, D-Mart's prices seem *much* cheaper overall compared to Big Basket.\n* **Big Basket with Tata Neu:** The cashback (5-10%) is attractive, but even with that, I feel like D-Mart might still come out ahead because their base prices are lower.\n\nFor those who’ve used both:\n\n1. Do you think the Tata Neu cashback makes Big Basket worth it, or is D-Mart still the better choice overall?\n2. How do you feel about the quality and variety of products between the two?\n3. Any other tips or strategies to save on groceries?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences! 😊",
    "comments": [
      "You go to dmart, you do some physical activity, you have some fun.\n  \n2-3% of reward benefits are not worth the health benefits. Just my opinion tho. Plus you can pay via their app which has some offers running always",
      "Use live+ in dmart. Nothing can beat that",
      "We've been going to dmart since 6-7y for monthly groceries. One thing I've noticed is more than 50% of the items you get cheaper (like waching machine liquid etc) when you order through Swiggy (using the HDFC swiggy card)",
      "Dmart is definitely better since there's no one selling properties saying \"Tata Neu ke saamne\" /s",
      "No doubt D Mart is better than a big basket with Tata nue even Flipkart grocery specially with VIP membership is even more cheaper  than D Mart , Flipkart gives more discount offers on your  grocery purchase.",
      "Get RBL ShopRite RuPay and you can get 3% \"valueback\" on Dmart. RBL advertise 5% but after redemption+99+GST fees, it comes to 3%. But works on offline card swipe, UPI or online. This is for self-employed folks who cannot get HSBC cards.\n\nSalaried should just get HSBC Live+ CC for 10% up to ₹1000 on Dmart and all other grocery/food/restaurant expenses.",
      "Well I haven't done much shopping in DMART, Star Bazaar is nearby I mostly use that. I wont go into much past but will tell u recent last 1 year exp of offline mart vs online apps price difference.\n\nNote: My comparison is for Bengaluru location.\n\nIn earlier days Flipkart Grocery used to sell cheapest items, it was my first preference to use with Axis Flipkart card. Issue was for delivery I needed to wait 2-3 days.\n\nThen Bigbasket started selling cheaper items, I chose this because it used to give 5% coins using Tata Neu app.\n\nThen Zepto SuperSaver started giving cheapest items, I used this for a while, issue was its minimum order was 600 that time else need to use normal Zepto where pricing is way higher.\n\nUsed Blinkit Instamart sometimes when some card offer free cash or special coupon they give, usually their price is higher but on adding these discounts it becomes cheaper.\n\nOnly sometimes I saw Amazon fresh selling cheapest items,\n\nOne thing common with all these online items was quality of veggies, it was never consistent, its hit or miss, sometimes good quality comes, sometimes best and sometimes pretty bad. But good thing was u can keep the item and get the refund but that was irritating, u cant always be happy by getting the refund sometimes u do need the item. And many times i need to console with avg quality product like in 1 kg potato 1-2 spoiled piece can come and then just for 1 piece it's not very convenient to return full pack. Moreover availability is an issue in online, most of the times it happens like I want Nandini Cow milk and English Oven Paw bread, then in 1 app milk wont be available and in other app bread wont be available, it forces me to buy whatever is available there. and in no single platform you'll find all cheapest items, So I usually end up buying different products from different apps, now they all will be having certain minimum order value to get better discount, that pushes me to buy more products in cart which I might not be even needing it now may be I need after few weeks, just to get more cart value I needed to add those items, so even if I actually need to buy 600 worth items , I somehow end up buying 1000 or more, see its grocery item , it wont get wasted I know still, I feel guilty. Plus the time which gets wasted in doing comparisons and when ur family  sees WTF he is using mobile all the time, that's really problematic. \n\nNow coming to Star Bazaar, u add all card discounts and coupons with online pricing, that's the price of Star Bazaar, almost 80-85% of the items u can find cheaper than online, rest will be comparable with online. And I'm talking about branded packaged items, loose items and own star branded packets r further cheaper. Add HSBC LIV+ discount for 10% that's unbeatable deal. Packet size is not an issue anymore, I can easily get what size product I want, availability of the product is good. Although it requires travelling but it saves my time compared to online. Even if u leave the pricing the quality of veggies are great, it's super fresh, best thing is u can choose and pick it. I can take any quantity u want not necessarily 0.5kg or 1kg. Veggies are easily 30-60% cheaper than online and even cheaper than local mandi in some cases, add 10% off here also for HSBC. One thing offline supermarket provide is it's shopping exp which no online platform can provide, it's fun and addictive. So whether it's pricing, quality or shopping exp Star bazaar is definitely my No 1 Choice unless it's raining outside.",

I  am planning to close HDFC diners Millennia  ( LTF ) as even after multiple emails they are not ready to upgrade to any other card ( ltf ). Even though its LTF i dont want to keep multiple cashback cards.",

      "1. Yes you can transfer limit just call CC and they'll tell how much  limit can be transferred.\n\n2. It's ltf so I don't see the problem in keeping it if you want to upgrade. You just have to use it more and be eligible salary wise for card you want to get.",
      "Is hdfc millennia your only hdfc core card? If yes, and if its lft why close it? You can just let it be, this way the limit on it will always be 0% utilized on your cibil and help you be under 30% for overall utilization",
      "1. You can call sbi cc for the same and may close the simply save.\n2. My suggestion do not close the millennia card as it have other benefits. I read your other comments about upgrade in DCP. \nYou can do one thing: Call hdfc cc or write an email to HDFC cc to change the card network from diner's to Visa. It will give your card more acceptance with visa offers and path to upgrade regalia gold.",
      "On 2nd point.. salary wise i am eligible and spend on card was decent ( close to 1.5 to 2 lpa per year ) , still they want to charge 2500 for upgrade to privilege card while its ltf for new members !!!",
      "You can just keep it in a drawer and disable transactions, bcz once in a while you get hdfc instant discount deals, which are really good.",
      "Yes, did same. Got my simply save credit limit transferred to cashback card. Also , not closing millennia card as per everyone’s suggestion.",
      "It's fee has been reduced to 1000 but even then it's not worth it. After millenia there are only 3 cards worth upgrading to RG, DCB and infinia.",
      "Good suggestion. Yes thats only hdfc card i have. I was thinking to get another hdfc ( only ltf ) once i close this one. They refused me Hdfc Privilege card ltf and hdfc new infinity ltf just because i am existing customer.",
      "That's great move",
      "Did you applied infinity from tata neu app?",
      "No, as per offer it was LTF only when you apply through hdfc, through new app it was fyf.",
      "First year free isnt a bad deal itself, plus you can get plus variant and 1 lakh fee waiver, similarly for infinity."

However, I recently received a Yes Bank Kiwi RuPay credit card and now have the option to pay using this card.\n\nMy concern is that the society management imposes a penalty if the full maintenance amount isn’t received—even if it’s short by a small amount. I want to confirm whether this issue could arise if Yes Bank deducts a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) from the payment.\n\nFor example, if the MDR is 2.5%, only 97.5% of the amount would be credited to the society’s account. In that case, would I be liable for the penalty due to the shortfall?\n\nAdditionally, is there any way to avoid this issue while using the Kiwi credit card? I’d prefer not to use third-party rent or maintenance payment apps or websites.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

      "usually residential societies are legally registered under some act as per ur locality, so they will be having some MCC, and credit card payments will be charged for sure, even if its under Rupay UPI. If ur society is using any community management app like Mygate or NBH, it'll show the charges directly on payment page , if u r using QR then u will not see the charges but they'll deduct it internally, so better to be safe, add 2% extra and pay or if its ur first time, u can try paying only the maintenance amount, usually RWA don't impose fine just for small dues, even if they levy some charges u can request for waiver for 1st time, high chances r they'll waive off and u can exactly get to know how much % is getting deducted.",

Just sharing my experience\n\nI've been using Flash.co email for nearly 6 months and had pretty good experience and also received very decent rewards from them. \n\nSo far, I've received 2 Swiggy INR150 vouchers, 2 Swiggy INR100 Vouchers, 2 Swiggy INR50 Vouchers, 1 Amazon INR200 Voucher, and earlier it was also possible to redeem flash coins into cash via UPI like Kiwis so I received around INR750 cashback back then. \n\nIt's pretty simple. You just link you shopping apps with their email and earn flash coins which you can redeem for gift vouchers from their catalogue. They also have some random coupons for 100-200 coins which are useless and a waste of coins so don't redeem for that. \n\nOn top of that, they provide really detailed insights on your spends analysis where you can check your spends category wise and expand it into brand wise analysis. I find it really helpful since it's very hard to keep track of Apay spends for me. \n\nThis has actually decluttered my gmail inbox very well and their own spam/promotion filtering is also good in my experience. \n\n\n\n\nNOTE: I used multiple flash.co emails which has earned me these rewards collectively as I use multiple accounts for apps like Zomato, Swiggy, etc. \n\nThis will not work for apps like Zepto who do not send an email invoice. \n\nI have no privacy complaints from them but still, I would not recommend linking any financially related service \n\nThe rewards catalogue is user specific and keep on changing almost everyday so don't be worried if you don't see anything worthwhile. Just keep accumulating the points and wait. You will find a good deal eventually. ",

      "So I was actually thinking of making a post if I receive the HSBC card but I'll give you an answer to your question for now.\n\n1. Swiggy cc: Till the middle of last year I only had a moneyback+ card, I got Swiggy LTF offer on the app so applied for it. Got it. Luckily the moment I got it, the settlement to cc statement was announced for the cashback. Used it extensively till September until I got offered Millennia upgrade on the Moneyback+ FYF.\n\n2. Millennia: Millennia I used everywhere except for Swiggy until I received a Kiwi card in November. The renewal fee will be waived off since 1 Lakh in a year is not that hard.\n\n3. Kiwi: I was on the waitlist and they offered it to me on the app. Got it immediately. It's LTF and I use it for UPI.\n\n4. Airtel Axis: Got notification on the Airtel app that I am eligible. Applied, got it, I didn't plan to activate it since it was paid but then it was the most limit in a card I have ever received so activated it. With the welcome voucher it became basically FYF. I don't plan on spending the minimum amount for renewal fee waiver, this card gets 500+ cashback per month easily which will compensate for the renewal fee.\n\n5. Amazon Pay CC: I was being offered the card literally a week back on the Amazon app. Took it cuz it's free, I don't have much use for it, will use it only if I have any transaction above 20k on Amazon. Otherwise Millennia is good enough.\n\n6. HSBC Live+: So this is the only card that I have ever really wished for lol. It's quite perfect for my expenses. I applied for it through the cashkaro app, they will give 2200 cashback if my application gets approved and then the card will give 1000 voucher if I spend 20k in a month. So basically my joining and renewal fee will be covered for almost two years. \n\nI have no interest in the Flipkart Axis card and SBI cashback. I don't use Flipkart much and SBI cashback is not required because I have the same and in fact some better deals on my other cards. Also, SBI cashback seems shit because it mostly gives everyone a terrible card limit which reduces the cashback potential per month to a huge extent.",
      "I'm having Onecard since last 3-4 yrs, but never checked about its offline offer, only got to know about this once it was devalued",
      "Best is that it has no capping on cashback. 5% on Amazon - all purchases. Simplest card reward system to understand and avail.",
      "You cant pay more then 5 or 10k per light bill from Amazon pay voucher. (I think )",
      "It doesn't give 5% , only 2%",
      "Does LIC and other insurance companies accept payments through Amazon pay wallet?",
      "But If you use an APay card you will get unlimited 5% cashback.",
      "Pay utility bills from Amazon pay section you get 2% cashback",
      "Thanks for such elaborate response with timeline and everything , perfect. Currently I have regalia gold (not really CB I know), swiggy and amazon. For UPI I wanted to get neu infinity but they won't give me ltf ofc so I wanna know between ixigo(0 forex as well iirc), icici coral or kiwi. I'm not fully aware of ixigo,kiwi banks and their services so not sure if I wanna apply, but since I got my amazon card recently I wanna wait for 2 months which should be enough for research targeting LTF cards for now(preferably the ones whose benefits don't overlap like you mentioned).",
      "I've paid 15k for electricity bill previous month",
      "Pay from Amazon pay",
      "No its 2% on utilities",
      "What is the hack of vouchers?",
      "Yeah, if any card is paid then the benefits should not overlap in my opinion. LTF is a must for me as well moving forward.\n\nBtw Kiwi just gives a yes bank card bro. It's one of my favourites, no nonsense immediate cash back right after the transaction. Also they give the 2% cashback on a minimum transaction of 50 which is great for UPI. If any transaction is crossing 100, usually I prefer using my millennia card anyway as of now.",
      "Ya that only I'm asking. Does it work?. Coz lot of places Amazon pay(i.e gift card balance not upi) isn't accepted",
      "I know the limit on utilities.\nIf you plan to use those Amazon pay balances for purchase on Amazon there is no advantage over using APay CC.\nBut how much you can pay utilities per month?",
      "For?",
      "Sure I’ll look into it, thanks for the info.",
      "Pay from Amazon app itself dude",
      "Like buying an amazon pay voucher and then paying the bill through the Amazon pay app?",
      "There are some credit cards mostly super premium CC’s like Infinia ,DCB, biz black and a few others which give you accelerated reward points when you purchase gift cards from sites like gyftr.\n\nYou can buy Amazon pay vouchers from there and then load into Amazon wallet and pay bills and keep the reward points."

I also applied for the Kiwi card (RuPay) but got rejected due to \"internal bank policies\" — I really wanted that one!\n\nAfter some research, I’m leaning towards getting two cards:\n\n1️⃣ A RuPay card (still deciding which one)\n\n2️⃣ An Amex Platinum Travel card (I heard it’s great for benefits)\n\n\nThe challenge is, I don’t have a CIBIL score since I’ve never had a credit card before.\n\nAlso, I’m buying an iPhone soon, and there’s a ₹3,000 discount on ICICI, Kotak, and SBI cards.

If it's available, take it . This way you get an unsecured card , a start to your credit history and credit score, and also discount for your iPhone purchase. \n\n\n2. Get a FD backed secured card, something from either idfc ( idfc wow )or hdfc ( hdfc tata neu fd card ) or super money etc. Use this for 3-6 months to get a good credit score and then take what card makes sense fr you. \n\nDon't look at amex right now without a credit score. Extremely tough to take. Also amex especially PT makes sense if you have 4L spends annually and you can utilise the rewards for travel . Else it's not good. I have an amex trifecta, once you get your first card , dm me and i can guide based on your spends and stuff.",

The cashback is super quick - it’s credited directly to my bank account instantly, no waiting around.\n\nJust to give you a breakdown: I’ve got ₹4348 in cashback so far. ₹2000 (₹1000 x 2) was from referrals (which is pretty sweet), and the rest came from payments I made. The cashback process is way faster than any other card I’ve used before.\n\nThe 2% cashback is insane. I’ve used the Axis Ace Card, which also gives 2%, but that one only credits the cashback to your statement. This one gives it directly to your bank account. Honestly, that’s a huge difference.\n\nAlso, I hit the ₹50K milestone and got cashback for that, and now I’m waiting for the ₹1L and ₹1.5L milestones. Can’t wait to see what happens next!\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a solid card with quick cashback and decent rewards, definitely check this one out.",
    "comments": [
      "I have this card too and while it's decent, let's be real about the \"2% cashback\" marketing. I get ₹3 (12 kiwis) consistently for UPI transfers which is nice, but the main cashback system isn't as great as advertised. Here's why: you only get 1 kiwi per ₹50 spent, and it only counts in ₹50 increments. So spending ₹249 gets you the same 4 kiwis as spending ₹200 - that's not really 2% anymore (drops to 1.61% in this case). For true 2% cashback, you should get 5 kiwis (rounded up from 4.98) on ₹249 spend.\n\nAlso worth noting all these perks are tied to the Neon subscription. Yes it's free for first year, but after that? Just another regular Rupay card.\n\nAxis Ace cashback was real 2% cashback (now 1.5%) which gets adjusted to the credit card due.",

It's a personal opinion but I do not believe Tata Co-branded cards are that useful and they are Over Hyped because the cashback comes in the form of Neu Coins in the Tata Neu App - and can only be redeemed for Tata Brands. Plus the app is hella buggy - according to users feedback. Along with that, IMO, it's not a good one for general-purpose usage. \n\nSwiggy HDFC CC is way better in that regard - since it's 5% general CB works based on MCC and not partner brands, Cashback gets adjusted in next statement and also Swiggy has 10% CB on everything from the app.\n\nAnd if you can't get Swiggy HDFC CC, I would personally rather go for Milennia.\n\nNow if you already applied, well you have a CIBIL hit already. So most likely nothing can be done. Plus HDFC is most likely moving towards a One Card Policy and no matter what card you take you can't apply for a second one online.

Super money - reward points varies as per paid amount.  No rewards from upi money transfer. Cash reward and can be transferred to bank account \n4. Phonepe - account deleted. Bloated but nothing can beat cred 🤪\n5. Kiwi - bad experience. Despite having a cibil score of 790 kiwi didn't accept my form and after that the app became useless as I had lost access to the qr payment option too. \n6. Samsung pay - being a galaxy user it's quite convenient but don't understand their reward system.  +1 for their quick access from home screen. \n7. Apay- Good since I also own a ICICI card. Not sure about upi cc rewards.\n\nMy goal is to keep just one upi app for most the features including bill and qr based payment. BTW having following banking app too\nAxis, IDFC.\n\nLet's discuss 😄",

      "Hope this day never comes in your life but you should avoid activating auto-pay for credit cards.\nThe reason is that time can change for anyone, and someday you might not be able to clear the dues(hopefully it never happens to you), then apart from using recovery agents or arbitration proceedings, CC issuers can't do shit to you legally. But once your auto-pay fails due to insufficient funds, they can take legal action under section 25, just like the ECS bounce case.\n\nI am not saying you should use cred or any other app, but you should always pay manual payments, best and instant payments can be done through the issuer bank(if you already have a savings account with it) or you can pay through upi or billdesk.",

Then slowly their cash backs went down and finally it was either 1 or some voucher like GPay does.\n\nSo, I stopped and moved to HDFC PayZapp which is their own app. So the whole pass the parcel won’t happen.\n\nNext, Cred is in the business of data collection. The app is not the product but you are. Your information is being collected and sold to someone you don’t know.

    "selftext": "\nHi everyone, I’m facing an issue with CRED and need some advice on how to resolve it.\n\nBackground:\n\nBefore I turned 18, my father updated my number on his SBI account so I could use it for transactions on his behalf as he was working outside of India at the time and my mom didn’t really understand banking stuff. \n\nSince I was using this account, I had added it to my CRED app along with my own personal bank account of Axis Bank which I had opened in early twenties as a salary account. \n\nThe Issue:\nI made a ₹27,000 payment on 27th Feb via CRED from my SBI (under my dad’s name) account towards my Axis Bank credit card bill.\nThe transaction failed, and CRED refunded the amount, but instead of returning it to the source account (SBI), they mistakenly credited it to my Axis Bank savings account (which I rarely use and had a negative balance).\nBecause of this mistake, I haven’t actually received the refunded money in my SBI account, and it was instead adjusted against the negative balance in my Axis Bank account.\n\nWhat I’ve Done So Far:\nI reached out to CRED support, but they haven’t been helpful in fixing the issue. I sent an email to grievance officer but all i received was automated response saying escalate this t grievance officer by clicking here but then when I click at the shown link its asking for a ticket. I dont have a ticket at all. I called them and asked to raise a ticket the agent said they credited to account which was quicker. They wanted to ensure quick refund so they didn’t think it was important to credit money back to source account. Which is clearly under my fathers name. They had justified this mistake by saying i kept Axis as my primary account so it was ok for them. Is it really ok?\n\nI also contacted Axis Bank, but they say they can’t reverse it since the money was credited to my account. Its a huge sum for me, I got laid off from my company so this is all i had. I wanted to make this payment and close the card until I get another job. \n\nHas anyone faced a similar issue with CRED refunds?\nWhat’s the best way to escalate this to get the refund sent to the correct account?\nShould I take this up with SBI or RBI complaints?\nWould appreciate any guidance on how to get CRED to fix this. Thanks in advance!\n\n#askreddit #cred #incorrectrefund #helpmereddit\n\n",

      "This.....👍🏻 Cred or whatever Platform you are ON, refunds on Default account only. Until you paid from your Credit Card. Not Cred Fault.\n\nAnd for the negative balance account, I too have my Axis Bank account in negative from last 4 years. I have told Bank many times to shut it down, But they don't. Every year they settle on their own and set it to 0 again😂😂😂😂",
      "I decided to close the account since they kept charging me heavily for not maintaining minimum balance like 1280 per month. I had emailed the RM to tell him that my account was zero balance account but Axis kept charging me and now i want to close the account and he had informed me I need to pay 607 rupees as minimum to close the account. For your context, I am currently not residing in India hence I could not visit the branch to close the account. I had planned on closing the account during my next trip back home. \nIt can only be done at my branch it seems. \nI was hoping for the amount to be refunded to source account once the payment failed.",

      "Bro, if you don't want to use that account, as it also has a negative balance, just delink it from everywhere. And let it go in negative. Banks can't do anything. In the end either they settle it back to 0 themselves or close your account by tagging it Non Active for long. Personal experience with SBI. Now Axis Bank is doing the same. I have talked to the Manager and He asked for an account closure fee, same as you, But i denied and said, keep account active till you wants 😂😂😂😂 I don't Care 😏",

It will crawl your email & basically collect a lot of data before it allows any access.\n\nAmazon pay- simple UI etc, no shenanigans, very straight forward but cc bill payment is not convenient. Most apps just need the last 4 digits of your card number and phone number to fetch the bill but in amazon you have to enter the whole card number, expiry etc which is highly inconvenient and irrelevant for bbps\n\nPhonePe- okayish UI. Some payment methods like debit card are charged extra fees. The main issue I faced with phonepe was that it keeps randomly blocking my payments saying \"for my security\". customer service is non existent.\n\nPayzapp- good UI & fast app but doesn’t allow you to customise the amt you are paying. You can only pay the full amt due so thats a bit of a deal breaker for me cos many times i pay in parts.\n\nGoogle pay- fast and efficient. Good UI. No rewards.\n\nMobikwik- bit clunky UI, you get burried in a lot of options and can’t really figure out what the app wants you to do. Some cashbacks are there but nothing very substantial. Again charges on payments via some debit cards, asks for email permission to fetch total amount due (which it can fetch directly from BBPS). Its an okayish app. Payments work flawlessly but other areas are a bit shady or lacking.\n\nJio finance- Easy to use app, very fast, very convenient, no rewards. Only problem is amex bill payments via UPI. Doesn’t allow upi id ending with @sc there’s some bug in their system.\n\nBHIM- very light no nonsense app. Sometimes gives random cashbacks.

      "People complain about banks giving their top cards to them but HDFC just giving the freedom one, here OP is proving them all wrong😂",
      "Lol. Actually Infinia came along later (All the way from Regalia>Infinia). MyZone and Neo are there for Swiggy and Zomato (twice a month). I have thought about closing most of these so many times but then overthinking takes over. That’s why I reached out here.",
      "Could you mention very quickly what you use the other cards for? Just like you mentioned that you use the Axis cards for Swiggy and Zomato. That would help me give you the right suggestions",

      "**The Usage:**\n\n1. LIT: Flight tickets if on card offer (rarely)\n2. MyZone: Swiggy (twice a month)\n3. Neo: Zomato (twice a month)\n4. Infinia: Lifeline\n5. HDFC Swiggy: so far used for Swiggy only\n6. RubyX: During SALE\n7. SBI SimplySAVE: During SALE\n8. Coral: Day-to-day UPI transactions\n9. Legend: Movie tickets (BookMyShow)\n\n**So far no real use cases:**\n\n1. Bob Premier\n2. Celesta\n3. HSBC\n4. IDFC\n5. SC Rewards\n6. Yes UPI Card\n7. Yes MARQUEE (closed already)",
      "Using Lit for discounts on flights while having Infinia is like adding a USB fan to the radiator of a Lamborghini to cool it down more. And you're paying for this card too, so I really don't see the point. \n\nMyZone is redundant because of the Swiggy card, so I would ditch it.\nNeo is fine for Zomato but you'll get better returns if you buy Zomato vouchers from gyftr with Infinia.\n\nSwiggy might be worth keeping, but again, you'll get better returns by purchasing Swiggy vouchers with Infinia\n\nDitch Rubyx. Coral will cover the ICICI merchant offers\n\nDitch Legend. You'll get the Bookmyshow BOGO offer more consistently with Federal bank Celesta and IDFC Wealth gives the same on Paytm.\n\nFor the rest.. Keep Wealth (for free RSA and 10k no questions asked refund on flight cancelation) and Celesta (for BOGO and merchant offers). Ditch the rest. \n\nPremier gives nothing of value, so you'd be better off getting BoB Snapdeal as a free floater card and asking the bank to close Premier (I'm planning to do the same). And the remaining are just terrible cards. Ditch them ASAP.",
      "Thank you so much!   \n  \nPlease help me understand how 'getting gyftr vouchers for Swiggy and Zomato with Infinia' is a better deal than using flat 40% discount with AXIS cards. Buying vouchers is unknown territory for me.",
      "You are getting flat 40%, but from what I remember, it's limited to ₹120? Also, you'll get it only twice a month.\n\nAnd you're kidding, right? Buying vouchers via Smartbuy gyftr is one of the primary reasons why people get Infinia! This gives you effective returns upto 33.3%!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/wIHLJVa50T\n\nLook into this post. The 10x, 5x, etc accelerated reward rate comes from buying vouchers through the gyftr portal",

The exact deal with the last payment date rule - Shouldn't the 16th March EOD (23:59:59) be considered the last date for the payment which is 3 days after the end of 13th March? There must be a deterministic rule about this, how can I make my case in case they are not reverted back...\n3.

In the call the executive said they will give temporary credit never said that you’ll be charged Debit Interest. Yes you heard right they charged Debit Interest for the Temporary Credit they have given around 832rs. The debit interest they charged was around 505rs. This is really scary. I didn’t ask for any temporary credit they themselves given that. My issue was resolved I contacted bank and confirmed the issue got resolved. When I happen to see my card statement I saw Debit Interest is being charged for the Temporary Credit. Never take any temporary credit from Axis Bank Credit Card for any case.

The options in the red striked off box are something that I donot have access to.\n\nRecently I got my hands on my first CC which is the **Supercard** from Supermoney (FD Backed to generate and build credit score). One of the benefits is **5% flat CB on Myntra**.  \nSo while looking at this list of available options, the most that makes sense to me is **10% CB on BHIM App & Rupay CC on UPI Txns**. There doesnt seem to be conditions of minimum purchase of so&so and max CB upto so&so. Please do correct me if I am wrong. So effectively that gives me 10% CB on Bhim + 5% CB on Supercard = 15% total\n\nHowever the other options of \"Upto 500 CB on Rupay CC via Phonepe/Paytm/Cred\" seem very tempting but since its \"UPTO\" I could very well be just getting 1 INR too isnt it? With the BHIM App Rupay CC option I am guaranteed 10% BHIM CB + 5% Supercard CB\n\nWould really appreciate if you guys can share your experience and which payment option would be optimal. I do shop quite a bit on Myntra, previously just did UPI txns but now slowly getting into the CC and CB game.\n\nThank you\n\n[myntra payment offers](https://preview.redd.it/xqxuajnl0ane1.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=37ab92c77740b0c474b4fff13eb336ffaf7ccbc4)\n\n",

Actually you don't need apps like these, you can call banks and change your bill generation dates once a year and you can sync all the dates as per your convenience. For paying the bill, you can add your credit cards as beneficiaries in any of your Mobile banking app and send money instantly through IMPS, some even accept payment through UPI. Cashbacks are just a bait to hook you to the app. Sooner or later platforms will remove the cashbacks. So better option is to keep it simple and also r/fuckCRED",

They are looking at the service provided. \n\nIt is tedious and tiresome to track and follow multiple credit cards and their due dates, balances etc. They built a solution for that. Then they expanded to allow paying all kinds of bills. All such operations cost money so they added vouchers and ads as monetization options. \n\nSure as hell users weren't gonna pay for paying the bills when they are crying about not getting enough cashback for paying the bill, will they?\n\nWhat you are getting is a way to pay your bills at one place. To track your spends and etc. I personally only use their payment option and track the bills manually. But that's just me. But I am neither delusional or entitled enough to demand compensation for using their platform for my gains. You and I always have the option to not use it.

In the end, it's a data mining company that is using us to make profits. In return, all we get is CC management. \n\nIf all the company does is show ads to earn money I would be happy but with all the fancy UI and stuff it puts in front of us is a gimmick as it is using our data. \n\nIt's like you have a restaurant business and the guy at the counter rather than just knowing the daily payments gets deep into your financial details, and uses them to make a profit is shady.\n\nIf cred comes up with a monthly plan of 200rs a month or completely ends all the coins, wheel spins, useless coupons, etc, and just do the cc management and keep my data private, the app stays simple and finds some revenue model like many productivity apps, etc do its cool.\n\nThe issue is Cred this Cred garage etc, why, if they are trying to be more than cc management then the future will be chaos on the app? Or are they under pressure from investors to do more and build more for some future profits or is it just Kunal's personal vision to make it a Paytm-type app we don't know, we are just scapegoats being played by big corporates who make money through data.",

But i need to stay with Samsung system and it is like part of premium phone price i paid to Samsung (as far i know others can't use that unless having samsung phone)",
      "You do realise you have the option of not using it? It is indeed a data company. As most companies are. The reason they are trying to be more than a CC management company is because CC management is not going to pay their bills. There is no money in that. Even if they charge a 200Rs subscription. Which if they do they will lose all customers except for maybe a few thousand at max. That won't pay the bills either.\n\nThey are trying to do many things to monetize as well as see what will work with users. Financial apps don't have much venues for making money. Every single UPI apps is losing shit tons of money. Every bank is losing shit ton of money footing the bill of UPI. If they didn't have other venues to making money they would fold."

(I have 100% on-time payments)\n\n• It shows the last payment on one of my cards was in Oct 2024, but I have been paying the bills every month on time, as mentioned above.\n\n• I got a limit extension on the same card as above on 10th Feb, but the report still shows the old limit, despite clearly mentioning that the last update CIBIL received was on 15th Feb.\n\nLastly, I would like help on how to dispute all of these. Thanks in advance :)\n\nTL;DR\nFree Credit Report on CIBIL website shows score drop of 14 point in just three days after checking on Cred, no major transactions, on time payments. One credit card's data shows old limit which is increased now and wrong date of last payment (have made monthly payments on time).",

      "First of all, CRED is a bill payment app, so it has nothing to do with maximizing benefits.\n\nSecondly, if she is actually spending over 1L a month, she needs a far better card than a Rupay one, unless all her spends are offline, and all those vendors accept credit cards.\n\nSo, you need take a step back and start with what does she spend her money on, and through which method (online or offline)? Unless you mention the approximate expenses, their categories and the methods, it's very difficult to suggest something\n\nAlso, when you're spending 1L+ monthly, the card doesn't need to be LTF. You'll hit the annual fee waiver of 99% of the cards, and even if you don't, the benefits would far outweigh the fee",
      "For UPI Kiwi is the best plus approval rate is far better than neu, coral, etc\nEasy trick to get kiwi approved - Put in salaried, mention salary >6L. Choose any company - work address should be in the same city as current address.\n\nShe already has a Swiggy so online spends are more or less sorted, LTF cards won't give you more than 1% on offline spends, which is what Kiwi gives as well.

      "Rent is a big no no. Don't pay rent using credit card because there's no benefits and you have to pay extra charges.\n\nNow, coming to the spends, none of these warrant a UPI enabled card. So, I'm not sure why you have mentioned that as a requirement.\n\nAlso, I asked you for details of categories and how much she spends on those categories but what you gave me very little actual details but anyway. From what I can glean here, if you're booking flights often, go for cards like Axis Atlas or Regalia Gold. For online shopping, SBI Cashback. You already have Swiggy for food, but because you already have a co-branded card, it is highly unlikely that HDFC would issue her a core card like Regalia Gold. Gifts are not a category, so it depends on what those gifts are.\n\nI would like to come back to the 1L + number again because that's an incredibly high amount of expense. Is she a salaried employee, and if so, where does she have the salary account? That bank would be most likely to provide her with the best card possible. If she's spending that much, she'd most likely have a high income as well, so cards like DCB Metal, Infinia, Emeralde Private Metal, Magnus might be within her reach and to be honest, are probably the ones most likely to be the best fit\n\nIf she has a business, she can get cards based on her ITR instead of monthly salary. So, any bank where she has an account would still be the best option",

    "selftext": "I feel there are a few issues with Cred/cheq and similar apps.\n\n1. Privacy point of view - They require complete access to your email, for Amex they ask you to provide Amex username password.\n\n2. Too much bloat/ugly UX - Because they are a free product they try to cross sell you a lot , with so many ads and stupid gamification .  Core functionality is hidden.\n\n3. Not really built for “premium segment” customers. I.e They claim it’s an exclusive app targeting the 1 percent, but I’m pretty sure the 1 percent does not care about cred coins , and quick loans that cred keeps trying to sell you.\n\n\nSo given all this, here is a pitch . Imagine an app\n- Does not require access to your email or sms.\n- Only Helps you pay , manage and view all credit card bill. \n- Gives you some basic analytics on whether you’ve been charged fees etc.\n- No other service. Just credit card management.\n\nHowever, the app will cost you 99rs per year in subscription fee.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1iz80dx)",

I am not going to pay 99 rs and then also share my financial data.",
      "Data won’t be used at all.Thats why you’re being charged a subscription fee.\n\nAlso , bbps and banks give a commission for facilitating bill pay. So that is a separate source of revenue that covers by per transaction costs.\n\nYes you’re right that if it was loss making (like how these companies are) i would be forced to charge you.\n\nBut, in this case that’s what the annual 99rs is for.",
      ">bbps and banks give a commission for facilitating bill pay. So that is a separate source of revenue that covers by per transaction costs. \n\nI am not sure. BBPS gives commission to the app facilitating the payments. \n\nBut have you read the requirements for implementing BBPS? I think the minimum requirement  is that a company should have \"Minimum 1 year of experience in providing payment and technology solutions i.e., payment gateways, transaction processing platforms, CBS platforms etc.\" \n\nYour company should be complying be a lot of other payment and data-related compliances.   \nAlso, direct MPLS connectivity with NPCI (is entirely based on approval by NPCI). \n\nIf you have explored all of these and think you can make a profitable business out of it, go ahead.   \nIf you need a developer, let me know (on paid basis )"

I was reminded of it by call from hdfc card recovery and they sent me some link to make payment, I didn’t think about any foul play here, ok. \n\nNow this month, the exact same thing happened, the app started giving me errors a couple of days before my due date (22 feb), I tried multiple times during those days and same issue happened. This time I tried to add it to HDFC bank neft payment but you cannot add it or make payment from there, couldn’t add it to cred or phonepe or amazon pay either. So there is absolutely no other way to make a payment apart from payzapp app. \n\nI raised a ticket about this on 21feb and was promised resolution by 22feb but received no reply from there till today, there is no call based customer support, there is no chat based customer support for immediate assistance. So basically using every tactic in book to extract that late fees? \n\nMagically the app started functioning on 23feb and I was able to make payment. \n\nThe biggest problem is that they deduct limit from your main hdfc credit card while assigning this cars but then when I tried to request cancellation it says that limit will not be reversed and it is gone! WTF. \n\nTLDR: pixel go trying every trick in the book to extract late fees and spoiled cibil. \n- no way to make payment except payzapp\n- cannot add it to cred or pay using other platforms, not even hdfc bank. \n- if you cancel it the limit that was deducted from your main hdfc credit card will not be added back.

Auto debit was enabled and money was sent. When I looked in their app its was showing 4.5 Rs as still outstanding. So i went to their office and the staff said even if there is some outstanding it will be cleared automatically and you receive NOC by mail.  4 th of every month was emi date. But on Feb 5th their agent called me and said there is still 4000 Rs as outstanding saying this was interest for the 6 months moratorium and auto debit does not work for this and I have to pay manually. I asked him whether they will report this to CIBIL as late payment and he assured me it will not, Me being naïve actually believed the guy and paid the amount and got the NOC in two days and that was that. 2 months later I applied for a SBI cc and outright rejected due to low CIBIL. But the last time I checked My CIBIL was 789  So I  checked my CIBIL  and it was at 683 due to late payment flagged by TVS.  That Year I was having the worst financial problems of my life. I can t apply to loans or credit card due to Low CIBIL. I had to get miserly that entire year . Now i have clawed back my cibil to 778. If it was not for that my CIBIL would have crossed 800 by now.",

I currently hold the following credit cards and loan accounts:\n\n#Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card – Using it for the last 4.5 years, upgraded twice automatically, now at ₹6.5L limit. This is my main card for all spending.\n\n\n#OneCard (Federal Bank) – Using for 2 years, upgraded once, now at ₹5.1L limit.\n\n\n#CRED Cash Line – ₹5L credit line at 17% interest p.a. (I know CRED is bad, but this might come in handy in a bad day).\n\nEverything except APay-ICICI is mostly for backup.\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n1.\tCan I continue using these credit cards and loan accounts after becoming an NRI? Or will they get closed once my savings account is converted to NRE/NRO?\n\n2.\tis it possible to convert these into NRI-friendly credit cards?\n\n3.\tWhat are the best credit cards for NRIs that don’t require a fixed deposit (FD)? Most NRI cards seem to require FD-backed issuance, which I’m not interested in. Also LTF\n\nThanks",

Here is the breakdown on how I paid a 2.25L bill: (I won't include which payment method I used since that would make it more complicated)\n\nIND money:\n\nAmount - Cashback\n\n15002 - 38\n17350 - 19\n10000 - 12\n12000 - 12\n13000 - 16\n10000 - 13\n12000 - 14\n12000 - 13\n20000 - 18\n11000 - 8\n10000 - 42\n\nThis is random so you can get any amount upto 1000 i guess and the cashback can be used to pay next bill. \n\nCred:\n\n10000 - 4\n10000 - 3\n\nThe most useless one among all. \n\nCheq:\n\n10000 - 100\n\nI haven't used cheq in a while but I got a WhatsApp offer where next payment above 1000 would earn me 1000 cheq coins which is ₹100, and it can be used to pay next bill.\n\nBajaj pay:\n\n5000 - 50\n\nOffer of 50 CB for 1st ever cc payment via UPI. \n\nMobiKwik:\n\n5000 - 15 saved via using super cash\n\nI think this is a little complicated.. as you earn 1% supercash using a couple on every payment. I had some super cash and when I tried paying a bill it had a coupon to apply 15 super cash and it's off the bill \n\nAnd I paid a few thousand via Paytm for some specific offers but that's for cashback points. \n\nAnyway that's how I paid the bill. I know a lot of people prefer convenience and would like to pay the bill in one or two payments and that's upto each of us. I probably won't do it like this all the time but I just wanted to try. \n\nI used CRED to track the bill, if I pay some amount via another app, I just select mark bill as paid option and enter that amount so it's deducted and correct balance would show.\n\nALL of the apps instantly credited the bill to card.",

I don't know what scam is that and why do they even try. Their coins are worth 0 value literally. \n\nEventually I ended up buying a lot of vouchers over the course of 3 days and surprise surprise!! They are scam vouchers. The whole game is really that they are applicable on few items of the brand, not all! And these are items which no one wants to buy so they sell these off periodically in campaigns like these. That's not the point though, same vouchers are available on coupons and countless other websites, so it's not that CRED gave you anything exclusive either. I was even surprised that most of the vouchers people were just posting on reddit they found from different apps or offer. \n\nSeriously guys, what is the point of this app I never understood!!! They made the app look cool but the app in itself is difficult to use and their pathetic gamble addiction inducing games are such a time waste and just gives anxiety as you burn away all your coins and feel sad.

How these apps work is that they first take money into their bank account (as they are registered with the card network as a merchant) and then they do a transfer to your account (or your landlord account in case of rent payment). \n\n2. What this means is that the money is with them for a certain period in their own bank account. If there is an issue with the second leg of transfer (from apps account to yours), there will be no formal recourse available to you from credit card company or RBI.\n\n3. If the app decides to simply run away or simply deducts some money - you can do nothing. \n\n4. Usually the MCC codes assigned to these merchants are marked as high risks.

Below is my analysis based on payments I have done on all apps and discussions with my friends and colleagues.\n\nAssuming you are paying the bill of Rs 30K monthly on 1 card (for keeping the calculation easy). \n\n|Platform|First time|2nd onwards|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Cred|\\~Rs. 20-30|\\~Rs. 2-3|\n|Cheq|1% coins worth Rs 30|1% coins worth Rs 30|\n|Mobikwik|Rs 100|Rs 40 (pay full amount)|\n|INDmoney|\\~ Rs 150|\\~ Rs 40 - Rs 60|\n\nI think INDmoney is a new platform, so they are giving more cashback. I have accumulated Rs 761 cashback in last 5 months.\n\nSome tips to get more cashback:\n\n1. If you are transacting for the first time, go with the higher amount, guess everyone wants cream users.\n2. Always try to **pay your bill in full in one transaction** on any platform the chance of getting rewarded will always be higher(For Cred & INDmoney) - they do not want you to do payments on multiple platforms.\n\n**Janhit me jaari, let's get the most of this till it lasts.**",

To avoid late payment fees due to rounding issues (since they round off the amount), I decided to pay ₹29,602 instead. However, when I tried paying through CRED, it didn’t allow me to pay the full ₹29,602.\n\nSo, I split the payment. First, I paid ₹1,602, which was successfully credited to my credit card. Then, I tried paying the remaining ₹28,000, but it stayed in processing overnight, and the next day, the amount was refunded to me.\n\nToday, I tried again to pay ₹28,000, but the app forced me to pay ₹27,999 instead. I paid another ₹1,000, leaving me to attempt ₹27,000 for the remaining balance. However, this payment is now stuck in processing again, and I suspect it will also get refunded by the end of the day.\n\nEven IndMoney is not letting me to pay extra 1rupee.\nif this amount get refunded will try through cheq and last i will try hdfc app itself.\nLast month only i paid extra for my icici. now im facing this issue\n\nDoes anyone know what’s going on?",

What I care for is to get a reminder for my cards' payment and to be able to see my expenditure across all cards in a single app interface. What I wonder is can you not have an app that allows you to pay card bill using a payment aggregator like SBI or Bank of Baroda? Those of you who are either accountants or have paid GST/TDS/ESIC/PF/Stamp duty dues for a company are definitely familiar with these payment gateways. Their UI is certainly not as fascinating as RazorPay's but they always get the work done (not to mention you don't have to wait \"1-2 days\" for your bank to receive the money). I also found out that all banks have an API/developers portal for fintech opportunities. \n\nTherefore, is it not possible to:\n\n* Create an app\n* Use bank APIs to query credit card information for a user (after due verification)\n* Display that information to the user, including card number, bank, amount spent, points earned, etc\n* Allow the user to pay the bill using this app by going through an aggregator like SBI?  \n\nWithout any of the fancy stuff, this should work.

The only thing that might be a little concerning is that CRED can see my payment habits and where I spend my money.\n\nI really find CRED’s smart statement feature super helpful because it lets me quickly check all my card statements in one place! also card UI is good in cred but what there are trying with other things are little confusing. \n\nI do my payments before 2-3 days of due date so couple of hours of payment delay is no issue for me.",

This will help you maximize rewards even further.\n\n**Data Security & Privacy:** The data is securely stored in Firebase Datastore, and no card numbers are collected. So, you don't need to worry about privacy issues when signing up and trying out the tool. The community can use it confidently and help refine it. The calculator also works without signup if you are not comfortable with it!\n\n**Sharing & Community Involvement:** Please share this tool within your Telegram communities! We can fine-tune the features if users can try them out and report any issues. Rest assured, there are no plans to make this project closed source anytime soon—it's here to stay as an open-source tool for everyone.\n\nYour feedback has been incredibly motivating, and I'd love to hear more! Let me know what you think, any bugs you encounter, or features you'd like to see next. Your input will help shape the future of this project.\n\n🔗 Check out the updates here: [https://ccreward.app/](https://ccreward.app/)\n\n🔗 Contribute or explore the code here: [GitHub](https://github.com/aashishvanand/credit-card-rewards-india-calculator)\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",

Typically, when a merchant sets up a credit card machine, they provide the MCC, and it's up to the bank to ensure it's correctly assigned. However, mistakes can happen on either side, leading to rewards not being properly awarded.\n\nThis app assumes that both the bank and the merchant have assigned the correct MCC. If you're unsure or if you suspect an incorrect MCC, it might be worth checking with your bank to confirm.",

Couldn't catch this part, I went on to fill it out and received OTPs and bam, the card was used for Rs1.4L\n\nI immediately blocked the card the next minute and reported it to my bank. They said they'd investigate it. In addition the merchant name is www.cheq.one (it's fake, actual legal merchant name of Cheq is CHEQ DIGITAL PRIVATE Limited).\nI kept telling the customer care that this merchant is an obvious fake and will they be able to refund or not, on which they asked me to file a Cyber Crime complaint as well.\n\nIs there a scope of a refund/chargeback?

What app was it? You met the person directly?",

But there are more factors involved in such frauds so I won't say that there's no hope.\n\nFile a cyber crime complaint, escalate to RBI Ombudsman and give them all the details of the case. You'll most probably have to pay the bill in the mean time so if you delay that, it'll ruin your Cibil plus it attracts various other charges which becomes a new problem even if you get the disputed transaction reversed.\n\nSo pay the mean and don't be shy to follow up with the bank and RBI constantly. Tho all you can actually do is hope for the best",

Keep a low limit on transaction value of each transaction type which is to be allowed,for me its around 10k in most of my cards\n3. Disable international transactions always at all cost, and only toggle it back on when doing an international transaction.\n4. On Shady websites/outlets always use a card which doesn't have much limit to lose, ignore the reward points/ cashback sometimes \n5. Turn off atm withdrawals and tap & pay\n6. Whenever receiving a call which mentions an existing credit card train yourself to take caution\n7. Never ever install apks especially if received during call or on WhatsApp, always ask them for play store link\n8. When someone asks for otp on call always read the full sms before u decide to give, bank always mentions at bottom not to share otp, it'll turn the bulbs on.\n9. Always play with the scammers and do time pass and have fun",

Bank representative reaching out to you for points redemption (think for a second, what benefit do they even have if you redeem your points), sharing you website link via whatsapp rather than official mail, making you download app from their website rather than redirecting you to playstore, asking you card number in bank app where most banking apps generally don't even ask you your card number it is supposed to appear automatically. Also OTP for transactions clearly mentions the amount to be charged. After all these red flags if you are getting scammed then I don't think you should use any kind of online payment service at all.",

      "It is called phishing attack for a reason. It doesn't change the fact that the transaction was unauthorised even if OTP had been used.\n\nI didn't come across any t&c where the bank won't refund because it was a phishing case.\n\nOther factors like Fake Merchant and amount being more than my transaction limit also holds in my favour imo",

I heard that this happened effective from 24-July-2024.\n\nKindly confirm through evidence and if so, this would be a huge blow tbvh.\n\n===\n\n**Suggested alternative:**\n\nFolks can use CheQ to pay-off their Credit Cards, which will get you an effective reward redemption rate of 0.001%. This is significantly less compared to HDFC Billpay, but CRED gives you even worse (because there, it's a lottery anyway). Plus, that even if you are okay with the recent Privacy-related stuff happening around CRED.\n\nHowever, do read on for a few important points...\n\n**How does it work on CheQ:**\n\n* Say you spent Rs. 10,000/- on a Credit Card Bill Payment. You'll get 100 CheQ Chips (1% return rate, but this is gets worse...since this is the Gross Return Rate).\n* Now, when you are doing the subsequent Credit Card Bill Payment, you'll be able to redeem those 100 CheQ Chips; which will give you a redemption of Rs. 10 (so Net Return Rate is 0.1%)\n* It is important to know that there is a **monthly cap of 4000 CheQ Chips that a user can earn.**\n* Therefore, Rs. 4L is the maximum combined Credit Card Bill Payment a person can do via CheQ, which will max-out that platform (4000 CheQ Chips earned = Rs. 400 valuation 😂 I mean, I guess it's not zero so okay hahah)\n\n**When you have maxxed-out CheQ and still have any remaining Credit Card Bill Outstanding (beyond Rs. 4L) -**\n\n* So upon spending a minimum of Rs. 1,000 on Credit Card Bill Payments; CRED gives you random, lottery-based rewards that one can use for subsequent Credit Card Bill Payments.\n* This means, there is no need to pay the entire Outstanding Amount on CRED (this is important). It's not like they'll give you a huge cashback if you do a huge transaction, and we all know this at this point so 🤡\n* You already know what to do now: do multiple transactions of Rs. 1,000 only; across multiple cards (if you have) and on a daily basis (which means you need to start paying-off the bill about a week prior to the Due Date).\n* As per my experience, the average limit of cashback per card is 5-ish per month.\n* However, if you have 10+ cards like me, it doesn't mean you'll get 50 spins at the cashback lottery. The most you may get would be somewhere between 10-15, in a single month.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "The redemption of points must be in the multiples of 250. \nSo valid denominations would be 250, 500, 750, 1000, and so on. \n\nHowever, if it’s like, say “950”, it wouldn’t work. \nCan you confirm if this is the case, or is it something else?",

      "So suppose you have a credit card bill of Rs. 75,000. \nThis can be from one card, or across multiple. \nAs long as it’s not a HDFC Credit Card (because for some reason, HDFC Billpay isn’t applicable when it’s a HDFC-CC), you will get flat 1% cashback points that you can redeem as real cash into you bank account. \n\nThe value is 1:1, so 750 Cashback Points = Rs. 750. \n\nNow, for the HDFC Platinum Debit Card, it’s Rs. 750 and for some other variants like Millennia DC, it’s Rs. 400 or so. \n\nDo note that the monthly Cashback Points Limit is capped to either 400 or 750, depending on your card, so any bill payment above Rs. 40k or 75k (respectively), the extra amount will not be counted. \n\nAlso, the transaction must be done via the HDFC Debit Card.

    "selftext": "Hello, fellw credit card enthusiasts!\n\nI'm in a bit of a unique situation and could really use your collective wisdom. I have a set of credit cards that I use for specific purposes, and I've recently incurred a substantial bill due to family expenses. Thankfully, my family has reimbursed me for the amount charged to my cards 🙃.\n\nNow, I'm looking to pay off this bill in the most optimized way possible. My goal is to earn cashback or rewards for making the payment. I currently use apps like 'Cheq' and 'Cred,' but they haven't been very rewarding, jaise aap sabko yahan dekh the honge.\n\nI've heard of various methods and apps that offer better incentives for paying credit card bills, and I'm curious to explore them. I'm sure many of you have devised clever strategies to get the most out of such transactions.\n\nSo, here's my quest for you: What are the best ways to pay credit card bills that provide significant cashback or rewards? Have you used any specific apps or services that you would recommend? Any tips on how to mix and match payments to maximize returns?\n\nI'm all ears for your suggestions and success stories. \n\n**I have also attached the excel cutout of the amount so that you can tell the most optimized way for that card.**\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n",

      "Sorry to say but no one can help you here. Axis is not at fault, and Cheq as you mentioned is super useless. They are simply luring people as a \"CRED alternate\" with slightly better use of their coins.\n\nHowever, currently CRED, although with its shit rewards, is better at settlements since it has proper tie ups with banks, while Cheq is still growing. By the time they grow their settlement might improve but rewards would go down as shit.\n\nAs someone in marketing, I recently did notice they are buying store reviews to keep their rating up. If you'd scroll through the reviews you might be able to see it too. Actual play store rating might be close to 2.5 right now.\n\n  \n**Edit**: u/sksbkn I just recalled I talked to someone at Cheq a while back for running our brand offers on their platform, but we later decided not to do it, since we saw the reviews they were getting, and thought why should we take the bad publicity lol.\n\nAnyways, you can try emailing this guy I was talking to, maybe he can redirect you to someone who can solve your issue - [vineesh@cheq.one](mailto:vineesh@cheq.one)",

It doesn't matter when it got credited, you made the payment on 5th and your bank account was debited so banks will consider 5th as the payment date.\n\nThey have not received the payment and that's a Cheq's fault not yours.

      "Don't worry bro, nowadays technology is good enough to reverse the money or to manage these things where money gets stuck, it's very common. \n\nEither it will most probably be credited in your card or the money will come back to the source account. \n\nIt's because sometimes transaction gets stuck at the payment gateway servers. And its all automated, it will automatically be credited or reversed don't worry. \n\nSame happened with me with my one card, and that too using cred lol. But I was also worried but got my money after 18 days credited in my account. I remember I had to pay the late due got got it reversed by calling there call centre as it was the payment gateway not me. \n\nNothing much can be done here, just have patience. 20 days is enough (there's some rule of 5 day, and 20 days made by the govt or upi systems sometiing I don't remember) but it will either reverse or credited.

    "selftext": "-Its too dayum difficult to get an American Express credit card. If I share my personal experience after providing them with my bank statement, my past three month salary slips, my ITR fillings they still asked for two more proofs of income. Its too big a hassle for a card half of India wont accept. I get it you get referrals and gifts and all. But honestly its like luring kids into Omni with toffee. \n\nAmEx is like the Amway of credit card world. Its better to opt for other cards than this. For SmartEarn the minimum income is 4.5 LPA. I was 20 my first salary was 14k and HDFC offered me Moneyback with 40k limit still grateful for that. Amex has one thing and one thing only. Its name.\n\n-Cred is fine. People need to stop dissing on it. I know people who have won free TV sets via Cred. Yesterday I made two bill payments got like Rs. 12 sometimes I get 1. The whole point of credit cards was to make life easier and rewarding. People need to chill out. Pay your bills and relax not every aspect of our being shall earn us rewards. Those with credit cards are already getting better offers and deals that should be enough. \n\nThe main motive with Cred should always be easy bill payments. Fast and reliable. Thats its. Also to those who shall come up with Cheq or Mobikwik or HDFC RBL Cards. Its simple not worth it. Not everyone has an account in HDFC I personally got it closed. Pay through your cards and relax with the bills.\n\n-People make a big deal of conversion ratios, partner points. Booking Accor hotels, flights. The prices for those are already ramped up. So no big deal, if you try booking through a good travel agent you would get a better deal. Im surprised all these credit card enthusiasts never talk about. Also I always wonder how these people go on vacation this much. I dont get the time to simply do it maybe my bad.\n\nI personally have seen that HDFC SmartBuy and Axis Grabdeals sometimes offer higher rates for stuff than others. So it really isnt worth the extra points if the prices have gone high. Tried this with Myntra. You could see for yourself and you shall see the difference.\n\n-No one bank or credit card issuer sucks. Everyone make mistakes. Happens . Move on. You do what best gets you started. No need to follow on in others footsteps or get influenced by others.\n\n-Simple cards are the best. Straightforward rewards no siyapa. \n\n-Swipe, tap, enjoy. Its a tool to make life manageable and easy. Not a game we have to play on repeat.\n\n-MoneyBack sucks but it was a good start for many. \n\n-Comparing what you have to be and give to het Infinia it doesn’t matter. It’s a super premium card for the elites. It doesn’t matter how good it is when most of us cant get it.\n\n-Also a-lot of people ask this rate my credit card collection on this sub. Buddy you have it. Are you happy.? If you are stay that way. You don’t need validation from strangers. If you are not ask for suggestions. I think many are showing off many simply want opinions its fine. What suits you. Just sharing my stuff. ",

      "I kind of agree with almost 100% of this post. I would also like to add that the use case of Amex offline and even online is very tough. Even supposed stores that accept amex make it harder for you to use any amex cards. I am talking about Delhi. Maybe it is different in other cities. But the best thing you discussed was about travel cards. I don't travel a lot and when I do I always try to find certain hotels which are dog friendly hence travel cards are mostly useless in that regard.",
      "Yoo! Someone had to say this. \n++ On Cred too. With 24 credit cards, no other app helps. \n\nAlso I've had infinia for over 6 years. It was great when it had the 10x multiplier. But now I don't get why it's fancy. I have cards which give me much better rewards. Am I missing something?",

I’m in no way promoting Amex or anything like that.\nMy spends are around 2-3 lakhs/year. But I prefer Amex, because even with those points I’ll get at least 1 or 2 nights stay. Which will not be possible with the cashback I’ll earn on the same spends.\nSo for me the value of points is more compared to cashback.\nEveryone has different use case.",
      "I agree with most points here except CRED.Yes this helps to simplify payment.But it reads your whole email for just that purpose.This is a  valid privacy concern.And yes you can setup a different email just for cred.But that's not the point.I don't really care about the reward points in cred.But in terms of privacy CRED is bad.",
      "My main concern with Cred is was they ask for permission on whole mailbox, which is too much for too less in terms of benefit\n\nI decided to have separate mailbox just for bills and created rule to forward cc bills to that mailbox\n\nAmex did not ask any income proof atleast when I applied for card and process was quite straightforward, so I guess it would be based on profile\n\nDifferent people have difference experience on applying same card",
      "It is a polarizing card unlike the broad nature of sbi cashback,HDFC millenia ,infinia etc.either the redemption process is useful for you or not depends on you.these cards outperform DCB till the milestones are reached for these cards.no cards is as efficient for Marriott than this so people generally save enough points to subsidise a vacation by paying the hotel fees with the points.the biggest reason for amex is not the points,it's the customer service and the ease of chargeback if required.try hdfc or icici for chargeback once.",
      "Kind of agree with most except Amex . Amex was so smooth process that i literally referred 2 more people to it. \nI have decided to only use 3 credit cards and not more than that to simplify things.",

And I'm assuming this is coming from someone who has no experience with booking award flights or hotels.\n\nThe prices for good hotels are not ramped up. Any hotel that is good will obviously cost more than your average Oyo. People opt for brands here because of implied assurance. I stick with Marriott because of quality mattresses, good breakfast spread, complimentary lounge access, and many more benefits. And most of these brands have a [Best Rate Guarantee](https://help.marriott.com/s/article/Article-22050) which means the chances of you finding a better deal on third party travel agents are close to zero.\n\nJust understand that if traveling with cash was cheaper, I'd have taken a cashback credit card. Nobody fancies paying more for the same thing.",

At best, I guess they are using it for advertising or designing in house products. I am somewhat okay with that. Anyway, privacy is a lost cause around here. \n\nI own 10 or so cards, and I love that I have a single place to go and track all pending payments. I don't even pay through them, I use HDFC for that, but just the fact that I can see due amounts and dates for all cards automatically fetched at a single place is very convenient for me.

Other banks take 5-7 days.\nMy cards nfc stopped working twice and they sent replacement card the next day in tier 2 city for free.\nSame thing happened in idfc and they asked 100rs replacement fee lol.

      "True",
      "I have Amex cards but this is sooooo misleading. Very cherry-picked.

If anything it should be subtracted from the final gain. That would bring down the Amazon voucher reward rate to 9% for the first year and to around 1% from the second year. \n\nSimply said Amex is not worth it to someone with such low spends and someone who isnt interested in gamifying their spends.\n\nOne place where I think Amex stands unparalleled is when comes to disputes. I disputed a charge when buying an game online that i had already refunded a month ago and i got it back a day after I contacted them and showed the receipts.",
      "The card fees should not be added to the spends but reduced from the rewards. When you spend something, you get something in return, essentially a product or a service. Card fees are in neither category. If a fee waiver happens, the final gain of course increases. Total gain per the total spends starting the 2nd year- that's how the reward rate should be calculated. Welcome bonus varies, and skews the reward rate wildly unless someone goes on cancelling the cards just before the fees.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, Amex cards are great, many times have specific use cases, and like many other cards not for everyone.",
      "By gold charge fees, do you mean the annual charges?\nAlso isn't there a issue of gyfter only accepting 10k per card for Amazon voucher?",
      "I never said travel on cash or cashback credit card. My simple point was which you can happily disagree with. Savings of thousands and lakhs of points, to book tickets and stay isnt worth it. And DM me we can have a long discussion in ramped up rates. I can prove that much to you. Obvio not always the case with best rate guarantee although you can find alot of stuff against that also on twitter.",
      "These things many a times vary from user to user. Personally AmEx has not been a friendly experience. Which is strange since theirs is supposed to be this magnificent customer support.",

      "I got an AMEX MRCC Card recently, I had a decent cibil score and my credit age is less than 1yr. Amex still didn’t ask me for income proof or anything. But I got a less Credit limit of 50k, but still that’s sufficient for the transactions that I do in Amex alone. I have other bank cards as well. I primarily use it only for pay balance now. \nPlus which credit card company calls and explains how to setup everything and doesn’t sound annoying over the phone. \nPlus their app is very smooth to use and doesn’t have a complex UI. \n\nI can say with confidence that AMEX has one of the best services and if I am not wrong one of the very few cards that offer a monthly milestone benefit.",

If someone is earning 30-40k per month & saving 1-2k per month(best case scenario benefit on spending around 20-25k per month) by optimizing then it is much better to focus on increasing that base income as extra 1-2k per month isn't going to help much in any major thing in life.",
      "You need to understand that people who spend low don't expect an iPhone from their credit card rewards to begin with. And for someone who is spending as low as 100k in a year and saving 10k, 10k actually means a lot to them. So get off your high horse.\n\nAs long as a person is getting rewards worth 10%, everything is worth it. There was this post where the guy was earning rewards worth 5L by spending 30L. That's a reward rate of 16%. Maintaining a reward rate of 10%+ is very easy for spends upto 50L. And I don't know about you, but 10% is a lot for a lot of people.",
      "You seem to be confusing cc rewards/savings with income from job/salary. If somebody is saving 10k using cc on 100k spend in a year then they should focus on increasing that 100k income first. As for that guy earning 5 lakh on spending 30 lakh you do realise that for him that extra 5 lakh is cherry on the cake not the cake itself. Tl;dr focus on earning more first & then focus on cc savings.",
      "I'm not confusing anything, you're the one who are confused with the terms. This conversation was never about increasing your income, this conversation was about optimising your expenses to maintain a good reward rate, because your expenses are going to be there, whether you optimise it or not. So if you want to classify this as an income, you could consider it as a passive income. Because maintaining a reward rate of 10% ultimately means your income went up by 11%, or rather you got a 10% discount. And you can optimise your expenses and focus on increasing your income at the same time, it's not binary. So understand the topic at hand here instead of completely ignoring it.",
      "It is you who seem to mixing things up. You started this discussion with \"10% is very much doable with correct optimization, especially when you're not spending a lot.\" If you are not spending a lot then that means you don't have a lot to spend to begin with which is the real issue not your band aid solution of \"10% by optimizing cc spend\". This is also clear in your words when you say \"Because maintaining a reward rate of 10% ultimately means your income went up by 11%, or rather you got a 10% discount\". There is no shortcut to good base income, whether you earn 10% reward on it or 2% that is all secondary not to mention that \"10%\" isn't even guaranteed & is on mercy of cc companies to continue without devaluation."

    "created_utc": "2025-03-29",
    "selftext": "Let me make it clear why I am writing this post. The latest post about a guide to beginners' credit card pit-falls/Traps was written a month ago [Link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i4wbfp/a_guide_for_credit_card_beginners_common_traps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\nAnd today [u/sidthefreak](https://www.reddit.com/user/sidthefreak/) wrote a Rant about people asking about which card do I need to choose. Or how do I start my cc journey etc.. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/rHRqOXaeY2)\n\nBefore all the Credit card explanations and how to get it you need to know some basics and abbreviations.\n\nCC - Credit Card LTF - Life Time Free FYF - First Year Free Cobranded - These cards are collabs with different brands and banks APAY - amazon pay credit card CB- Cash Back card(this amount is usually credited to the next statement or wallet for co-branded cards.) EMP - Emerald Private Metal card (Icici) DCB- Diners Club Black card (HDFC) RM - Relationship manager (Bank employee who is appointed to you.)\n\nWhat is cibil score: - Its is a number between 300 to 900. which is used to measure quality of credit usage of the customer. (Thats the gist of it google to know more. Higher the score the better.)\n\nHere is a guide on how I would do it if I started my journey again. There will be 2 parts to it. so read it accordingly.\n\nPart 1:- For students or people attained the age of 18 and are eager to get a credit card.\n\nPart 2:- For Salaried individuals/self-employed who want to enter the cc game (Age does not effect this unless you are above 60Y).\n\nWatch part will have a subpart A, B read it accordingly. I am peeling a banana and putting it in your mouth don't spit it out eat it properly.\n\n**Part 1:** \n\n**STUDENTS**\n\n**Sec A Those who never took a loan from a loan app( really stupid loan apps that charge 11-16% interest). If you did take a loan read sec B.**\n\nYha yha, guys and girls calm down. Take a breath and hold your horses. Read this carefully. It is the beginning of your credit history, Trust me you don't want to mess it up. After 4 or 6 years when your study is done and you want to buy a house and take a loan, the bank will ask 2 things(Mostly) Your income, Your cibil score. ([How to guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1fyxa5r/how_to_check_credit_score_for_free_without/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Don't check it just yet continue reading.) If your cibil is bad Banks might reject your application or give you a loan at a higher interest rate.\n\nSo now you understand the gravity of the situation. There is no better way to do it. starting cc game. Here is how many members including me did it and succeeded(Do it at your own risk I am not responsible for anything you do.) Banks won't trust you just yet cause your initial cibil score is -1 which states that you never took a loan/cc in your life.\n\nTo gain the bank's trust you can get a secured/FD backed cc. This means that you'll need to do a fixed deposit and get a cc. Different banks have different rules on the amount of fd required etc. You can get any card if you are absolutely clueless you can always google, every bank usually has one. Here are some of the popular fd backed cards (IDFC WOW(20k Fd),icici platinum(50k fd)). There are Some cards that give you a cc on 2k or even 1k fd but it is highly suggested that you don't go for those cards. Better get a card from a reputed bank to get upgrade offers (And if you get a 1k fd card to maximise cibil score building you’ll need to use only 30% limit which means only 300/- per month). If you want refe\\*als li\\*ks you can ask the members of this sub to get joining benefits.\n\nAfter you get an FD-backed cc you need to wait 2 or 3 months (depending on when you applied and when you get approved for the cc) to check if your cibil is updated. It'll usually land between 650 -750 range. \n\nNow what you'll do is wait. Ok here me out. Don't do stupid sh\\*t with the cc. Pay the **total amount due**(very important). Every month try and use only 30% or less of the credit limit(Not using it will also affect the cibil score). Now wait at least 6 to 9 months. You'll usually receive calls that you are approved for this cc and that cc from call centre. Don't apply for those cards they'll usually reject you(no income & less than 1 year credit history) the last thing you want is a rejected cibil enquiry.\n\nOptionally you can open accounts in banks in which you want a cc and open a savings account with them. And start using that account to make the daily transactions. You might get a pre-approved offer in a few months and then apply to it.(Make sure its pre-approved it won't ask you for salary slips/itr only ekyc to get this card this was also optional in my case.) you'll get offers form Amazon Pay Later or others like these you can take them as an alternative if you don't get a pre-approved offer. But I highly suggest you don't apply for those it's easy to lose track of them in your early stages.\n\nYou wont get approved to the EMP or DCB cards just yet you'll need to start earning for that. Some colleges have tie-ups with banks and offer cc to uni students this is one of the best ways to get premium cards without income proof. Make sure to visit nearby branches and ask them( also look it up in google.)\n\n**Sec B Those who took a loan from a loan app and defaulted it (i.e not paid it)**\n\nMan, I know you have a stupid half-knowledge baked friend who suggested this app. Don't take me wrong but cut all ties with him/her. You don't need his help any more he did too much good till now. \n\nTake my suggestion and settle it or pay in full if you can. Try requesting if they can take away the bad report from your cibil (I know it's a long shot but its worth a try.) The process is the same as part A to get a cc. But i just wanted to let you know that you can check your cibil score and it'll most probably be in the lower end <550 or something like that. You'll need to wait at least 7 years to get approval for a good cc(Not compulsory but this is usually the case.)\n\n**Part 2:-**\n\n**Sec A**\n\nSalaried members Those who don't have bad cibil or do not have cibil at all. Same as the student part A but check your bank app to see if you have any pre-approved offers. You might have some. If not you can usually apply to any bank if you have a good salary you’ll be approved. But don't apply for too many at once. Apply for 1 at a time if you get rejected don't apply again for at least 6 months.(Not compulsory but a good practice.) \n\n**Sec B**\n\nBad cibil score or default in the past.\n\nSame as student part B. And be careful this time around.\n\nThank you to all those who read this far. Especially the members of this sub who already own a cc. I am pretty new here so show me some mercy and correct my mistakes if any in the comments I'll edit. And give me suggestions on which abbreviations I have to add to the list. The ones I added were the once I got most confused with in the beginning.\n\nThanks again, Hope I can do good to at least one person to make the right choice.",

The thing is most banks require a FD of a big amount. rn i don't wanna ask my parents to block a significant amount in an FD for me to get a credit card when I don't really need it but just want it. You mentioned that its not worthwhile to get into cards with super low FD amounts - is it really that bad?\n\nlike I was looking into superCard and a lot of people mentioned the low deposit amount required - is it not worth it? i don't really spend much except small amounts here and there spending on food and that's it. so my thought process was i could spend that using a cc and then pay it off on a regular basis (is it even possible to pay cc bills before the statement is generated? like can I pay using gpay or something every week or so?). \n\nwould appreciate some insight.",

They paid the bill before the statement date But still had high utilisation in their cibil history.\n\nIf you want to take that risk you can but. For a credit limit of 2k 30% is rs600/- If you eat out 2 time you'll spend more than this much. Since you want to build your score i wouldn't recommend it. You won't get any reasonable rewards with 600 a month spends. And not worth while. Idfc is the middle ground with 20k fd. Where as other banks need 50k which is a significant amount. \n\nIf you are determined to get this 2k fd card no one will stop you but. Make sure you use only 600 a month and no more than that.\nDm me if you want to discuss this further.",

All others are LTF. \n\nSome cards may appear to be redundant, but there’s a reason why I got them.\n\n1. ICICI Platinum: I had to get this to get the Amazon card. The local branch manager told me that if I get Platinum and wait for three months and apply for Amazon online on Amazon website, I’ll get it immediately. This is what happened. Got credit limit of 4L.\n\n2. SBI SimplySave: The agent misled me and told me that I need to get this for Cashback as Cashback is not issued as the first SBI card. I took it, but later complained to SBI in a long email, and they immediately gave me the Cashback card with credit limit of 3.59 L\n\n3. Yes Bank Uni NX Wave: I wanted a Zero Forex card, but IDFC was taking their own sweet time to approve Wow Card. So I applied for Uni NX Wave and got it. But I also got Wow card. Kept both as they are LTF. \n\n4. Axis Airtel, Axis Neo, and ICICI Coral were all pre-approved. I applied for them on their respective Apps and got them allotted immediately. \n\nAxis FlipKart is my oldest card and I am planning to close it since it is a paid card and I am unable to meet the waiver expense target. After SBI Cashback, this card became irrelevant. \n\nCIBIL Score was 791 when I started applying for these cards about six months ago. Now it is 779 due to 16 queries during this time. I won’t be apply for anymore cards now since I think I have all I need. CIBIL score should improve over time. \n\nAnd one again, thank you to everyone who contribute to this sub.

I've narrowed it down to two options: the AU Ixigo Credit Card and the Uni X Gold Credit Card.\n\nMy key requirements are a lifetime-free card (since I won’t be using it often, I don't want to keep paying for it) and zero forex markup fees. Extra benefits like lounge access or travel discounts (in Ixigo's case) would be a bonus, but they’re not essential.\n\nA. Why Uni X Gold?\n1. Lifetime-free card.\n2. Zero forex fees.\n3. I've heard that Mastercard offers better rates than Visa cards (based on forum discussions).\n4. I don’t have any Yes Bank cards, so I could benefit from merchant discounts with this card. (Please confirm if this is accurate.)\n5. 1% cashback on most purchases, which could be useful. (Not sure if this applies to international spends.)\n\n\nB. Why Ixigo AU Card?\n1. Lifetime-free card.\n2. Zero forex markup.\n3. I don’t have any AU Bank cards, so I could use this for AU merchant discounts.\n4. Free lounge access without a spending requirement. (I already have lounge access with other cards, but I could use this for others traveling with me.)\n\n\n\nC. How I plan to get a pre-approved AU Ixigo Credit Card?\nPlease refer to this link for details:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ixu8hs/can_i_get_a_preapproved_au_ixigo_credit_card/\n\n\nD. Why not Scapia?\nI’m not considering the Scapia credit card because I read that they recently reduced credit limits significantly. Given that, I don’t trust them at the moment, even though they are accepting new applications. However, feel free to convince me otherwise if you think it’s worth applying for.\n\nE. Why not debit cards?\nI am looking to avoid TCS payment upfront and getting it back a year later. Though, i already have some debit cards in mind if any of my credit card application fails.\n\n\nF. Question:\nCould you help me decide which zero forex credit card would be better? Should I wait for a pre-approved AU Ixigo card, or apply directly for the Uni X Gold card? I’d really appreciate your thoughts. Thank you!\n\n(PS- I’m not interested in credit cards like the Diners Club Black, which charge a forex markup upfront but offer equivalent cashback in return. I’m looking for a simple, zero-forex-fee card. Hope you understand!)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1ixujvd)",
    "comments": [
      "While Scapia may have reduced credit limits which happened once after a change in RBI Policy- I find them the best. I have both AU Ixigo and Scapia and I love Scapia's UI and UX (they are much better).\n\nI can immediately see the transaction on the app and the exact amounts (forex + INR) as well plus they have a live rate calculator available right on the app. AU Ixigo you need to wait for the transaction to settle to even see it on the app. Even after it comes on the app you can only see the INR figure without being able to correlate the forex figure until you get the statement.\n\nI haven't used Uni x Gold and haven't read reviews so can't comment on it.\n\nPS - I had Scapia first then got the AU Ixigo since they were offering reward points. Have used both for international trips now stick to Scapia. Last trip ended up spending a bit - got invited to their Scapia Experiences as well :)",
      "Both cards have very high rejection rate, honestly if u get any of them (scapia, ixigo, uni x) you should be celebrating ngl. Unless your income is like 2L+ pm and cibil of 800+ or smth idk tired of them :)",
      "Hey! Which one did you go ahead with? And how do you feel about your decision?",
      "I’m not sure, man. I still can’t fully trust Scapia, though I do appreciate their clean UI/UX. Regarding what you mentioned, I’ve seen screenshots of the Uni X card app, and it displays the currency rate and the total charged, so I can see the forex markup applied. But with Scapia, something feels off, maybe I’m just being paranoid.\n\n(Another reason for my hesitation is their partnership with Federal Bank. Federal bank seems like this new age neo-bank that’s collaborating with a lot of fintechs. My gut tells me not to get involved with Federal Bank right now, especially in case a new startup emerges. Since Federal Bank only allows one card per customer, and I have other options for getting a zero-forex card, I feel that getting Scapia might limit my chances of getting a fintech card I actually want. If Scapia partnered with other banks, I’d consider it in the future.)",
      "See in the end take whatever you’re comfortable with. Like I said Uni x Card I’ve not had any experience so can’t recommend.\n\nElse between AU ixigo and Scapia just on the basis of international spends and overall convenience I would recommend Scapia."

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience of building a credit score from scratch and getting my first unsecured credit card to now owning seven credit cards—all while still being a college student (this is not a flex but just experience of being patient and smart with credit utilization) I hope this helps those who are just starting out or struggling to get approvals.\n\nHow It Started\n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I got my PAN card and opened two HDFC savings accounts:\n\t1.\tHDFC Savings Max Account (Premium, ₹25K AMB) – Comes with a Platinum Debit Card with lounge access and insurance.\n\t2.\tRegular HDFC Savings Account\n\nFor a year, I routed most of my family’s and household transactions through my account. This helped me establish a steady transaction history. I also built a good relationship with an HDFC branch employee, which turned out to be helpful later.\n\nFirst Credit Card – HDFC Basic Card (₹25K Limit)\n\nAfter nine months, I asked my HDFC contact if I could get an unsecured credit card (without an FD). Thanks to my banking history, my request was approved, but I got only the most basic HDFC credit card with a ₹25K limit.\n\nI started putting all my expenses on the card, often exceeding the 30% utilization mark because, let’s be honest, 30% of ₹25K isn’t much. I always paid my bills in full and on time.\n\nBuilding Credit History & Getting Limit Increases\n\t•\tAfter one year, I got an email to upgrade to HDFC MoneyBack Plus, but my limit remained the same. A bit disappointing, but at this point, I had built a decent credit score.\n\t•\tAnother year later, I got a limit enhancement to ₹50K and a free linked UPI credit card (shared limit).\n\t•\tBy then, I had already applied for other credit cards, but they kept getting rejected.\n\nFirst Big Break – Amazon Pay ICICI (₹1.7L Limit!)\n\nAfter two years of credit history, I applied again for Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card. To my surprise, it got approved with a ₹1.7L limit! This was a game-changer because it offered great value, especially for Amazon Prime users like me.\n\t•\tA month later, ICICI Coral RuPay Credit Card was auto-approved with the same shared limit.\n\t•\tMy HDFC card got upgraded to BizPower, but still no limit increase.\n\nMore Approvals & Credit Growth\n\nAfter my ICICI approval, things started rolling:\n✅ UNI NX Wave Credit Card – Approved with ₹1.8L limit\n✅ HDFC Swiggy Credit Card – Approved\n✅ Axis Bank Credit Card – Recently approved\n💳 Total Credit Limit Now: ~₹7L\n📈 Current CIBIL Score (TransUnion): 781\n\nKey Takeaways from My Journey\n\n1️⃣ Start Early & Build Banking Relationships – A steady transaction history and a good rapport with bank employees helped me get my first card.\n2️⃣ Use Your First Card Wisely – Even though my HDFC card had a low limit, I used it regularly and always paid in full.\n3️⃣ Be Patient – My first approvals took time, but once I had a 2-year credit history, other banks started approving me.\n4️⃣ Pay Bills in Full & On Time – Never missed a single payment, which kept my credit score strong.\n5️⃣ Only Spend What You Can Afford – I’ve been lucky to have my parents’ trust, but responsible spending is key.\n\nIf you’re starting out, focus on building a solid credit history with responsible spending, and the approvals will come. Hope this helps someone! Feel free to ask any questions.",

So doing that with a credit card is just a good byproduct for the CIBIL Score. It also helps building financial responsibility and smart credit utilization. Approval for newer cards is also easier and when one does start earning it helps with an early start with better credit cards and limits. Atleast thats my personal point of view. I used to spend similar amount before as well, so i m just doing it now with a credit card under my name so i see it as a no brainer.",

SBM and Uni have mutually agreed to discontinue the co-branded Uni SBM NX Wave credit card program. We sincerely appreciate your trust and support throughout this journey.\n\nAfter 1st March 2025, your SBM Uni Credit Card will no longer be operational for new spends. However, you will still be able to:\n\n🔹 Repay your pending dues using your card until your billing date, and based on your billing date, it will remain active for repayments until April 1st, 2025.\n\n🔹 Redeem your Uni Coins via the Uni app until 31st March 2025. Any unredeemed coins will reset to zero after that.\n\n​However, we are in the process of introducing new credit cards in collaboration with different banks. Once they become available for your profile, we will notify you via the Uni application and WhatsApp.\n",

The card has paid itself very quickly.\n* **Amazon ICICI** \\- Rarely used. Has Rs860,000 limit so keeping it.\n* **IDFC First Wealth** \\- Rarely used but booked one airticket on EMI to enjoy a one-time discount.\n* **IDFC Wow** \\- My go to card to swipe abroad to save on forex conversion fees. **Yes UNI** was also taken for the same purpose but where possible, I use Wow when I am abroad.\n\nLast year across cards, I spent almost Rs11 lakhs (out of which \\~Rs2lakhs was on SBI Cashback and \\~Rs1lakh on the EazyDiner card). \n\nI wanted to know if I should see to consolidate spends in certain cases (skip the one-time EMI discount on air tickets for example) and so look to put it all on one or two rewarding cards?

      "A few questions\n\nWhat are your use case?\n\nWith that kind of spends, are you preferring Cashbacks over Rewards ?\n\nWith the cards like SBI Cashback, Amazon ICICI, HDEC Millennia, I don't think you are completely optimising your spends by simply keeping it in your wallet.",
      "I have been focusing on cashback since overall spends have been low for years, so it seemed pointless to chase rewards and spend more to use those rewards to achieve those legendary double digit returns. Now with spends steadily rising and cashback does have its own limits, I am exploring.\n\nMy key use cases are online spends (where SBI Cashback is my go to card - Amazon ICICI and Millenia are rarely used unless there is a specific discount to avail). I even prefer this card to pay via Zomato/Swiggy at restaurants unless I get better deals on EazyDiner (which is when my Indusind EazyDiner card comes into the picture).\n\nThe other use case is solo international travels. Currently I'm using SBI Cashback card wherever possible when it comes to bookings from India while abroad I use my zero forex cards.",

I also maintained \\~1L AMB for the prime plan but of no use. So was looking for an alternate Zero forex card. I have the Niyo Global card but since my international spending had already crossed the 5L limit, I can't use the card till April.\n\n  \nCards I considered: Niyo DCB in debit and IDFC First WoW in credit because I recently opened account in IDFC First bank.\n\nMy brother came across Uni Gold X when searching and asked me to give it a shot. There's one other review of the card and I just wanted to get out of Fi and was LTF so I applied. \n\nApplication process: Card is LTF for now. I applied through the app, completed VKYC on the same day(Friday). Uni approved on Saturday and Yes bank approved on Tuesday. The card shows as Uni Wave X in emails. But I don't think it's an issue.\n\nThe app's UI is okayish, but it keeps logging out. It has a lot of bugs like the limit switch is turned on when I turned it off a while ago. But I tried international transaction and it worked without any issues. Exchange rate was same as on MasterCard and no extra fees was charged (Fi charges 4% and refunds in 2 weeks). \n\nIf anyone is looking for Zero Forex, I think this's one of the cards to consider. Not sure how good the rewards are but I'm not looking at rewards in international transactions anyways. MITC attached below.\n\nLimit offered: 4L  \nPrevious limits: ICICI APay: 6.8L, HDFC Millenia: 2L - bought this 1 month back.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ldybx2fxxje1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c819673d89f7059b35c29de995c0ba78801c102\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b042cr2fxxje1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a79cc146965856f674bf20f64127d10c0eba3f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx6qcv2fxxje1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f68092543c782cca7a34ac21ddd365d650ad030\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/we8gp23fxxje1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd74f91d1a9d3160de41088dec768fdef14f7dfc\n\n",

I'm not saying they shouldn't block. They should inform after blocking. We were left in wonder what really happened because the CS executives also didn't know what was going on. They replied to our emails after 2 weeks after multiple escalations.\n\nI recently had high volume transactions again. They blocked my account which I'm fine with. But for more than a week there's no response after submitting my income proof and all necessary documents. It's one thing to block the account but at least they should have communication channels open. I was left in a void about the account and no one responds  from their CS team.\n\nI invvested in mutual funds using their platform. Their MF support is really bad.

I saw that the AU Bank Ixigo Card stopped offering rewards on forex and was wondering if there are any other cards offering rewards as well as zero forex (or high rewards but some forex charge)?\n\nI have a Onecard already so I am covered from the zero forex side but was wondering if it's possible to find a card with rewards as well?

Currently no use of this card but due to direct in other hdfc cards, I am still having this.\n\nHdfc swiggy (LTF) - I use this card for the 5 percent cash back it gives on online payment. Also for 10% CB on swiggy. (Currently most used card)\n\nHdfc Tata Neu infinity (not LTF) - Used to be my go to card before i got hdfc swiggy credit card. Even though I use Tata neu app mostly for Tata 1 mg, currently ordering medicines with Swiggy credit card as CB is same 5 percent.Also, UPI switched to Yes Kiwi credit card. Only usage now is utility bills. Not sure whether i should continue with this card.\n\nYes Klick kiwi credit card  (LTF)- Using for UPI payments\n\nIcici amazon pay  (LTF)- No use as I ise hdfc swiggy for shipping on amazon \n\nIndusind legend credit card (LTF)- Never used this card for any expenses as such. Even the for international lounge access, I believe i need to pay extra. So not sure any use of this card\n\nAmex MRCC  (not LTF)- Used to be my primary card till some time back but now it’s usage is reduced dramatically. Even with gold reward programme can get 6k or 9k as cashback with 18000 or 24000 points. So ideally after spending around ₹120000(₹20000 x 6 months) getting just around 18000 points (assuming 3000 points each month). So the base rate of CB is less than 5%\n\nAxis rewards - former citi rewards (not LTF)- Very old card but no use as of now ( need to spend 30k yearly to avoid renewal fees) My home loan is with Axis, should i ask for some other credit card instead of this one.\n\nI would be traveling to Japan and My future expenses would be mostly there, hence was thinking to get a forex credit card but both au ixigo and uni wave got rejected for unknown reasons.

    "selftext": "Till October 2024, I had no interest of diving into Credit Cards. Primarily because it took me 5 years to pull my family out of a debt situation (will create another thread on it).\n\nI had a Singapore Trip and even for that I preferred Niyo Debit Card. I [created a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1fotr4f/niyo_dcb_debit_card_vs_prepaid_forex_card_vs_cash/?rdt=64693) for same. But some places didn't have DC working and this entire incident introduced me to this reddit community.\n\nBefore October 2024:\n1. **ICICI Amazon Pay** (~35K CB in 2024, had quite a few flight journeys)\n2. **HDFC Business Moneyback** (got it offered as LTF and got 8.8L limit)\n3. **SBI SimplyClick** (it was my first CC) (technically LTF as I get Amazon Voucher for INR 500 annual charge)\n4. **Axis MyZone CC** (my second CC, and earlier used to get free domino pizza from points) (again, technically LTF due to voucher)\n5. **ICICI Coral Rupay** for UPI and ICICI offers\n6. **Yes Bank Uni Wave** 0 Forex LTF CC\n\nNow I get interested and tired of using HP Pay. Turns out there is an almost no nonsense card for petrol cashback, even better rates. I created an entire Excel comparing different CCs. Axis IOCL Premium topped my list but it had mix reviews. So,\n\n7. **SBI BPCL Octane Rupay** in my wife name (Already got 1600 worth petrol and first year waived off because I paid a vendor via UPI and got 1% RP. All of this in 1 billing cycle)\n\nAnother thing to add at this point is, until Oct Infinia change, I was eligible for Infinia. But I figured I am a frugal guy (well, mostly) and my biggest expense in last 5 years has been taxes. So,\n\n8. **HDFC Dinners BizBlack** (got 1st year waived off, 1.5L spent, next year waived off, 60k in RP in just 1.5 billing cycle. Dec is Adv Tax month). I am so sad I didnt use it for last 7 years!!! Getting this was a single signature because of 8.8L limit I got automatically.\n\nBut hey, all this Infinia thing kinda hit me up that I need a show off card. Also, I needed unlimited lounge for my family of 4. And I have pretty good relationship at ICICI. (I have roughly 16 accounts (Savings and Current) and 2 Home Loans in last 4 years in my close network)\n\n9. **ICICI Sapphiro LTF** for my wife as a safer move\n\n10. Today, got **ICICI Emeralde Private Metal** on iMobile - Single request and one month of wait. And, as my RM updated me, entire ICICI bank's leadership approval (lol! It is as crazy as everyone claims, dont even know for what reason). So yeah, unlimited lounge for my family, domestic and international. \n\nIn 3 months, I have probably super optimised my CC financial part as well. All thanks to this community. I bow down to you all for all those threads, comments and replies. You have shared knowledge that has already saved me 70k in last 1 month. And without changing my spending pattern for Card, thats the best part. Also, this sub made me smart enough to get 2 cards in Wife's name to minimise Credit Score impact and also build her score for future.\n\nI wish you all have a Happy New Year in advance and I wish to see more of you all next year.",

No FD no nothing. It got delayed by 15-20 days initially as the branch had some audit going. But then, I received proactive updates.\n\nThere are 2 reasons why I don't want to switch away from ICICI:\n1. The smooth digital banking: ICICI did this before anyone else did.\n2. This RM.

I had recently applied for AU bank’s Ixigo co-branded credit card (Lead ID-) as I was appealed by its features such as complimentary domestic and international lounge access and zero forex markup charges since I was going to travel to US soon.\n\nDespite having a good credit score (CIBIL-, Experian-), with a x% utilisation of my credit limit as per recent CIBIL report (₹27035/₹1924000) and being a salaried employee (Designation- Manager) at one of the top bank’s of India, today I checked online to find out my application is rejected with a soft enquiry on my CIBIL.\n\nI understand and respect that approving or rejecting a credit card application is at bank’s discretion as per their internal policies, but as per RBI’s guidelines, I would like to know the reason for rejection for my future consideration.\n\nI request you to provide me the reason for the rejection of my application for my future reference.\n\nThanks for your attention and consideration. Have a great weekend ahead!\n\nWith Regards,\n.\n\nSent from my iPhone",

The above picture is via amex > Apple portal. I am trying to understand how this No Cost EMI Works. Like cost of m2 is 1 lakh. Does this mean I only have to pay \\~92k? \n\n  \n2. I remember having discounts/cashbacks on hdfc before and also heard that amex is the new partner. So how does this goes now. Is there any upfront discount i can get. If so how can I avail that and also get some points (either cards works for me or via coupons is also fine if there is a way). \n\n3. I also have student option (brother is in uni) if incase it gets me cheaper price than this discounts + rewards (unless i cant combine all these options). Like in apple store or imagine store or even reliance or similar stores.  \n",

      "How? Can you help me out? thanks!",
      "Yeah you'll end up paying around 92k since 8k will probably be Amex discount but there will be processing fees and gst on interest too.\n\nCan you purchase from apple edu store?",

      "dm",
      "yes i can, and also imagine store (via hdfc ) as they also have student discount running and i have to fill a form or something there.",
      "please check your dm",
      "Idk about the imagine store since I don't have any HDFC card. \n\nYou cannot combine Amex discount with student offer so MacBook Air m2 which is 1L normally is 10k off in student portal so if you purchase it via there on SBI Cashback then you'll get 5% cashback on 90k bringing your effective cost to around 85.5k\n\nIf you purchase directly via Amex Gold then you'll get around 9k points for spending 92k. I'm not sure if extra points are also applicable on EMI transactions or not so check that already and read the usage terms for Multiplier then follow those instructions. It has stuff like cookies clearing, no ads/tracker blockers etc. \n\nHowever, 9k points are not worth 6.5k imo but that opinion can be subjective. I would say student offer + SBI Cashback is much better combo unless imagine store can offer something better"

Niyo Global Got delivered in about 4-5 days. This mini-review is mainly about the Niyo DCB debit card. Setting up the app and the card was a fairly straightforward process. No issues there. There are things I wish I had known beforehand when I started using the card -> writing a few things below -\n\n1. There is a 5000 INR limit for the first 24 hours for a newly added bank account if you're trying to add money via UPI. The way to circumvent this is an IMPS transfer to the DCB savings account via any bank account\n2. When you are loading money for the first time, it does an SMS verification on your registered mobile number\n3. When can point no 2 be a problem? -> When you don't load/forget to load money in India, and are planning to use a local pay-as-you-go SIM abroad (and not your registered number on international roaming)\n4. When is point no 2 not a problem? -> If you load money in India, OR if you're using your registered mobile no. SIM with international roaming\n5. I visited England via an Abu Dhabi connecting flight - I did not have to use Cash on even a single transaction in a 12-day trip spanning 4 cities. The only place where the card got declined was the London Tube - next point about that\n6. London Tube allows you to directly tap your credit card at the entry and exit gates, essentially like a metro prepaid card. One Caveat with this is - if there are two of you, you can't use the same card for this purpose - as the first tap will count as an entry, and the next as an exit. So the two people need a card each for a single journey. There were two of us, and the issue got further complicated because the Niyo Card wasn't working. Luckily, I had taken my Atlas and Amex Plat Travel along, and both of them worked.\n\n \n\nOverall, the Niyo Card was accepted almost everywhere except 1 transaction on the London Tube. I used it for both online and offline purchases when abroad and it saved me a decent amount of Forex Charges, without any of the hassle of a CC application process.\n\nMeanwhile, the Uni Nx Wave card is still processing my VKYC 1 month after I applied, went on the trip, came back, and sent them 2 emails about it. Have binned their app as well since I can't be bothered whether I get that card or not anymore. AU Ixigo rejected without reason. For now, have decided to use Niyo DCB or Atlas for spends on international trips.",

      "Yes. Banks see it as credit hungry behavior. Banks also generally have internal unpublished criteria of M-N - M hard queries max for the last N months. And even if you get a card or loan at this stage, CL won’t be great or rate won’t be good for loan. To build a good score, be patient and use your existing cards wisely for next two years - keep usage below 3-5%. Good luck on your credit building journey!",

      "yep",
      "30% is max for good behavior. Ideal is below 5% if you want score to build/improve faster.",
      "Both. That is the reason score goes up when one or more cards get CLI, while it also goes down if you max out on a single card with lower CL though overall CL maybe high. Formula for calculating score is complex and considers many factors, though overall weightage is as Cibil highlights. There are some published (non verified) algorithms online that you can find with Google. In short both limits are important.",

After VKYC the uni app showed 4 days to process the card. Waited for about a week until I forgot about it. After maybe 10 days the uni application still showed 4 days and I received a call from YesBank for another round of VKYC and my office address confirmation for which I cooperated.\n\nThen after a week I received a courier from blue dart from YesBank containing BYOC card! I thought there could be some mistake and wrote an email to YesBank keeping UNI in cc asking about LTF and Forex. For which they replied that it's a chargeable card. Meanwhile received a call from UNI team informing that my application was rejected by YesBank and whatever card I have received is from YesBank was to be checked from YesBank only. I have written an email today to cancel and close the card. I have not activated the card.

However, an Yes Bank agent called you to fulfil their own sales quota and sell whatever card they wanted. You did the VKYC and since it was a first party application, it went smooth and you got approved.\n\nIt's possible that uni card wasn't even rejected but due to your BYOC card approval, it got rejected",
      "Yes Bank is shady. I have a similar experience. \n\nI applied for a Kiwi Rupay LTF card from the Kiwi app. The partner bank was Yes Bank. VKYC done successfully. Kiwi app kept showing a wait of 4-5 working days. Finally, about 2 weeks later, the Kiwi app shows that partner bank did not approve the application. I end up with a hard inquiry on my CIBIL score, but no card. This was August last week to Sep first week. \n\nNow, October first week, I get a call directly from some Yes Bank card seller, saying you applied for a Kiwi card which is approved already. You need to do a fresh VKYC because previous one failed as the image capture of the PAN card was blurry. I pushed back saying why it was not corrected then before rejecting my application. She says, it took time but we're doing it now. So, I do the VKYC again. 10 mins later, I get a SMS from CIBIL that Yes Bank has checked my score. Another hard inquiry, means probably a fresh application. I check the Kiwi app, status is still same. \n\n2 days later, I start getting calls from Yes Bank to activate the new BYOC card, which is already showing up in the Yes Bank IRIS app. When I refuse, they say once you activate it, within the next 10 mins, your Kiwi virtual will start showing up. Now, I ask them which card network is this BYOC and what fees etc. Too much vague roundabout garbage, and just pleading to activate the BYOC from them. I flat out refuse, and told them I won't mind your BYOC if you make it LTF and will only activate it on that condition. Otherwise, it will just be auto-closed. They said they will get back to me. I disconnected the call and un-installed both the YesBank IRIS and the Kiwi apps.",

      "I recently applied for a Kiwi credit card, but it was rejected due to Yes Bank's internal policy. Shortly after, I received a call claiming to be from Yes Bank. They informed me that my application was denied because I had entered the same address for both residence and office. They asked me to provide a new address and complete KYC verification to retry for approval.\n\nI asked if this was for the Kiwi card, and they confirmed it was, so I went ahead. However, instead of getting the Kiwi card, I ended up with a BYOC card and a virtual RuPay card. I activated the BYOC card because I assumed Kiwi cards might be issued under a different name. It was only when I contacted Kiwi directly that I realized I had been misled.\n\nWhen I reached out to Yes Bank to resolve this, their responses have been slow and unhelpful. Unfortunately, all these conversations happened over calls and WhatsApp messages, and I don't have recordings or screenshots as the messages had a timer set and have since expired.\n\nWhat can I do to address this situation?",

First they will rejected kiwi cc then after 7-8 days yes bank employee will call for address verification for kiwi cc approval. he will take all the details then without telling about byoc cc they will applied it and take video kyc n within 2 days ur card will approve. In call he will convince you that kiwi cc will only approved not byoc. If we don't accept byoc cc then they will approved another rupay cc on  behalf of byoc cc its a pre planned scam. Before only they setup plan to issue byoc if customer reject they will issue virtual rupay cc. It's big scam by Yes bank. I only suggest who ever see My comment if yes bank reject cc after that if any yes bank employee call for verification don't do it. its a big scam by Yes Bank they will issue other cc instead of you applied.",

Could anyone share their thoughts regarding the UNI cards. Also is the card issued by SBM (which could face restrictions) or Yes Bank?\n\nI am aware that there are several other zero forex cards available but I'm not sure which would be my best option given the following:\n\n1) Scapia - not onboarding any new customers even though the reviews suggest it's the best.\n\n2) AU Ixigo - not issuing at my current pincode and verification would be a hassle.\n\n3) IDFC First WOW - would prefer this but it's an FD backed Credit Card, my First preference is an unsecured card.\n\n4) RBL Safari - the reviews suggest it a great card but the joining fees & the annual fees are relatively high.\n\n5) Federal Amplifi - zero forex but I've read it deducts 1% forex markup which is refunded, but you need to keep contacting them everytime.\n\n6) Niyo SBM Credit - FD backed card. SBM also seems to face issues with foreign transaction, so not reliable.\n\nThe reason that I am asking for a Credit Card rather than a Debit is to avoid the TCS upfront. As I'll study abroad, crossing the limit, I would have to pay the 20% TCS (which I can refund by filing my ITR later but It'll just take time to do so at the end of the FY) I would get the Niyo DCB Debit for Backup anyways.\n\n\nEDIT: should I be concerned regarding the exchange rates used by these cards, do all/most of the cc use the same rate i.e. Visa exchange rate?",

In my recent trip to Switzerland, almost all of the transactions done via Yes Uni came out closer to the expected conversion back to INR, they were a little bit higher in case of AU Ixigo (not much but 15-20 ₹).\n\nThe exchange rate is usually calculated from what it is 2-3 days after the transaction, when its reflected in the unbilled section (the amount increases instantly so u can keep screenshots before a transaction if u really want to, but it often fluctuates).\n\nTLDR - Go for this card if possible, its a good one.\n\nEdit - the AU Ixigo card gives reward points on international transactions as well, which can be redeemed at an even better value than this minor difference.. so that would be probably better.\nYes Uni doesnt give any cashback for intl. transactions.\n\nEdit (28 Nov, 2024) - AU is stopping rewards on intl. transactions after 20 Dec this year",

Well, if u can get the Ixigo AU card, it would be better, otherwise this card is also good if u just want 0 forex.",
      "Note that u wont get that cashback for foreign spends, its just for the domestic ones.. & if its for spends above 7.5k something (not sure though)",
      "Damn, if u had AU Ixigo it would have given u loads of rewards for this one",
      "They were exactly equivalent ig, u just have to check the mastercard/visa website for the exchange rate on the day of transaction or on the day it gets added to ur bill (i dont remember which one but its one of those two)",
      "Thank you for the reply, what documents did you have to give? currently I have no other Yes Bank credit card.",
      "I do have that. But I'm not sure about the forex charges currently and what exchange value are they offering for USD to INR",
      "I dont exactly remember the documents but the process was familiar. Might have uploaded payslips but thats all ig, everything else was just general info. inputs",
      "U can check the VISA site, plus the reward points offered by them would obviously be of greater value (check the limits & max RP per billing cycle first). https://www.visa.co.in/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html\n\nCapping of 10k RP per billing cycle is there so, & online transactions get 10RP per ₹200, now u can do the math.. good luck with ur mega purchase 💀",
      "I went to the Yes bank branch as it's 15 mins away from me, they said they cannot process the UNI card from their branch and were offering me Elite+ card, I already have Regalia Gold, I just wanted something which has 0% Forex.\n\nI also wanted to know what limit did they give also? also when you applied, you get the verification call from UNI people or Yes Bank or both? I read some comments and they said after getting verified from UNI, they also got a call from Yes Bank for re KYC and then they sent some other card.",
      "Oh man, thank you very much.",
      "Ohh damn, well u can just apply it online right?\nThey gave a limit of 3L to me, it's the highest amongst all my cards.\n\nAnd only the videoKYC was done ig, no verification calls & anything from neither uni nor yes bank",
      "Thank you for the reply, sorry I am not much of a tech savvy person, but I assume Video KYC means that they will do a video call and ask details? or I will have to take a video of my Pan/Adhaar card and sent to them? In how much time did they send you the card?",
      "Ohh no problem at all. Yeah, u have to be ready with ur physical PAN & click on the link that they send you, a Yes bank agent will join there & then he's gonna ask a series of questions (u have to answer them as u have mentioned in the application form), then show them ur PAN, thats all.\nI got my card delivered within 7 days (i was in Pune at that time)"

If you are paying ₹1500 upfront and then paying ₹1500 as 2nd EMI, means your effective loan is ₹1500, not ₹3000. This app is lending your money to you at an astronomical interest rate of 60%. with RBI closing the liquidity tap, these NBFCs are finding creative ways to make money.\n\n  \nDont go for such apps!
