Received Tata Neu Plus Rupay 2 weeks ago. Closing before renewal. Need validation.,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jck3bn/received_tata_neu_plus_rupay_2_weeks_ago_closing/,2025-03-16,"I had a secured IDFC Wow and a Kotak League Rupay. I had got these for Lounge and UPI respectively and it was convenient since I had good family level relationships with both banks. Having used these for 2 years and frequenting this sub I realised I wasn't really earning anything in the name of rewards or cashbacks so I decided to close the secured card (regretting now as it was LTF and Visa Infinite: 1+1 on BMS) and get 2 new cards: SBI Cashback Mastercard and Tata Neu Infinity Rupay.  
I got the SBI one easily with a 90k+ limit but HDFC only gave me a secured Tata Neu plus. Having had both the cards for a couple of weeks I have learned a few things:   
1. Tata Neu app is bs - like the worst shopping or finance app I have ever used. Paytm was a thousand times better at both.  
2. The Neucoin cashback system is too variable and complex. I have yet to understand how can I get the promised 7%.  
3. Even if I do get the 7% back in neucoins, it means I will have to use them instead of the card the next time which I think technically results to an effective return of 3.5% which is less than what SBI offers. (I have also been using my father's Amazon Pay card with prime and at least I can use the cashback in places I won't actually get the 5% CB, so I am using APay wallet when only losing out on the 1% CB transactions.)  
 4. Having a co-branded HDFC card is not a good idea if I'm hoping to get a core card anytime soon. (Based on the discussions on this sub).

Since most my transactions are online, I am pretty content with a straight up 5% from SBI. When I do use UPI it's mostly for chai coffee (lot of txns < INR 100) and it is my understanding that Tata Neu CB doesn't apply to them.

For some reason I could not get the Kiwi card so I am going to keep this card for UPI transactions for a while, but I have decided to close it before the end of the year. Until then I am hoping to find a replacement for a good cashback card for UPI. 

In the near future I am also hoping to get a separate fuel card (fuel spending \~40-45k p.a.) and enter the Amex world. Would value your inputs.",[],kiwi
