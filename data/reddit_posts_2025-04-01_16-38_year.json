The rest of my cards came in within the last year.\n\nMonthly expenses approximately range around 5 to 8K\nGroceries, food, quick commerce & utility are my typical expense categories.\n\nCurrently I hold the following CC (all LTF):\nOneCard (Indian Bank) : 20K Limit (Metal Visa and Virtual Rupay)\nAmazon ICICI : 80K (Visa)\nICICI Coral : 80K (Rupay) Shared limit I guess\nCSB Edge : 20K (Rupay) via Jupiter (salary account)\n\nMy current flow is to put utility on the Amazon ICICI card (random coupons for ‚Çπ10 - ‚Çπ50 off etc).\nEdge card (2% cashback on dining enabled) for food delivery, restaurants/bakeries and quick commerce apps.\nCoral/Edge rupay cards via Kiwi for merchant purchases (supermarkets, medical stores, books).\nOneCard with 0 forex offer for random one off online purchases.\n\nApay cashback, jupiter jewel and kiwi coins are my main \"rewards\" off of CC. I do not care for lounge access and do not travel much (Two 50km train rides in UR per week at most).\n\nTo sum it up, how is my card utility and how can I improve? \n\nPS: I have applied for HDFC Swiggy Credit card and it's currently pending.\nCIBIL score sitting at 786 ",

If you get Swiggy LTF, then your saving would increase plenty on food delivery, dineout, online shopping, etc.\n\nIn order to improve discounts on these spends you might need to switch to a paid card like Axis Airtel (utility and food delivery/dineout) or SBI CB (online spends). \n\nI also feel you should switch to Super money app from Kiwi. Super money would give you some CB on every UPI transaction whereas in Kiwi you need to spend minimum 100‚Çπ to even get 1 Kiwi.",

In case you aren't able to get your Neu card upgraded, this would give you lounge access.

It was approved almost instantly, and I was given a limit of 1.2L.\nIt offers 5% cashback on all online purchases, which is pretty cool. Though, I don‚Äôt want to start spending just because I got this card :p\n\n\n2. One Card:\nI got this about 2 years ago. The metal card sounded cool.\nI try to use it for high-risk transactions. Sometime back, I had paid an advance to colive.com. When I went to the property, they told me that the rooms were full and the support asked me to go to a different property. I'm not sure if this can be labelled as a scam but I still reached out to the OneCard support and submitted all the necessary proofs. The transaction was reversed about a month later. This was a while back, so I‚Äôm not sure how customer service is now, but I love this card for getting my money back without any hassle.\n\nThere are occasional forex offers, which were useful during my Singapore trip. Other wise the rewards are pretty bad.\n\n3. Play:\nI used to go to the movies regularly. The 500 Rs monthly off on a 5k spend felt like a good deal, and it was also advertised as free if you're a BMS superstar (which doesn‚Äôt exist anymore). I‚Äôm planning to close this card since I rarely use these coupons. Sometimes there's a discount on Zepto for RBL Bank cards.\n\n\n4. Ixigo AU:\nThis is a forex card. I made a huge mistake by opting for Rupay. If you're planning to use it for foreign trips, please go with Visa. Rupay supposedly partners with Diners, and the customer care told me it should be accepted if the ATM accepts Diners cards, which was complete BS. I tried over 20 ATMs in Singapore and Thailand, Nothing worked. I now use it for all my online international purchases. I also got a priority pass.\n\n\n5. HDFC Millenia:\nI use it for Amazon, Flipkart, and Swiggy Instamart purchases. You get 5% cashback on the first two. Someone on this sub said it applies to the latter as well.\n\n\n6. Diners Black:\nI do not own this card; it's an add-on. My dad got it as LTF a few years ago. This is my default lounge card, No cap on the visits. International lounges inside India allow both the primary card holder and the addon, but Qatar lounge let only one inside ( Either the primary or the addon). I'm not sure if this is the case for other airports as well.\nI sometimes use it for domestic flight bookings, but Skyscanner‚Äôs flights are almost always 1k cheaper. Swiggy Dineout offers a good instant discount on Diners Black as well.\n\nAlso, the 5X rewards on forex loads are super useful, but they expire in March.\n\n7. Airtel Axis:\n25% CB upto 250,  I use it for my postpaid bills.\n10% cashback on Zomato, Swiggy, and BigBasket up to 500 every month. 10% Cashback upto 250 on my utility bill. I'm saving 1k every month, Solid card.\nExtra points for the Axis Bank app.\n\n\nI think I‚Äôm all set.

If you swiped your card for 10k and the statement was generated for 11k that's either someone using your card for fraud or you getting charged fees for something like wallet loading or annual fees being applied . There is no other explanation. \n\nThis sounds like you are not mentioning the full info. \n\nI agree about the cashback part, that's common knowledge. But the extra amount beyond your spending sound either like your card is being misused or you did too much wallet loading so got charged fees for it or something. \n\nMaking blanket statements and then not providing proper explanation helps no one. If you atleast clearly explain what is going on, it might help someone else who might also get put into this situation.",
      "Give an example of being charged more than spending. I had mental stroke trying to understand this.",
      "Might be a fraud but the bank doesn't want to listen\nThey are simply asking me to pay the mentioned amount \nThe mentioned amount isn't a big deal to pay for me but I just mentioned my experience \nThen I simply closed the card after 3 months of usage",
      "Bruh , again. how is it \"might be fraud \" ? It's either fraud or it isn't. Did you raise a chargeback ? If you raised a chargeback within the stipulated timeframe banks usually respond positively . Yes there are exceptions but most of the time , chargebacks have a positive result. \n\nSince you mentioned it might be fraud , I'm assuming either you dint raise a chargeback or you never realised the transaction happened and raised it very late. It sounds more like user error than bank issue. \n\n\nAlso , how is it specific to axis airtel card ? It's mostly a bank related or user related. \n\nAs much as shitty axis Bank is , with regards to their reward points and cashback and everything, this legit sounds like a fuckup from your side . If you as a user cannot specifically say a fraud is a fraud , how will the bank side with you ?"

Now, Last year, we shifted and I informed this to all the banks, even KYC updates have been given.\n\nI suffered a life threatening injury last year and had to go into emergency surgery, which drained us of our liquid savings of around 20L. My sister was in the car too and she suffered a hip fracture.\n\nAs a result, Both of us are completely unemployed for 1.5 years, till June this year due to recovery. As a result, most of the cards have fallen due.\n\nI have assured them that I have no intention of defrauding them and that I can present my entire medical history and bills to show them my injury is true, but they aren't listening. I offered settlement and got called a choice Indian slur, that I reported to ICICI bank with their agent name.\n\nNow ICICI and Onecard have gone to my old place, and found it locked. They are now saying I am defrauding them and they are suing me for fraud. I told them that they have my KYC, and they know where I live now, Who asked them to go to my empty flat? They are refusing to listen and saying some beautiful slurs about bengalis to me.\n\nNow, I have assets which are in the process of sale to invest and generate passive income, but it is taking a while. I assured them that they can take a bonded sign that I will pay off the entirety when this happens, but slur fest continues.\n\nI have stopped receiving their calls as a result because I have no intention of being insulted left and right despite legit reason and attempt at finding solutions.\n\nHow do I proceed forward? CIBIL has taken a hit for both of us, so loans aren't an option \n\nAnd yes, before you tell me, I know I shouldn't have used the cards if I can't pay it back.

    "selftext": "Hi bros - I‚Äôm new to the credit card arena so please forgive me if I‚Äôm not making sense anywhere throughout. I follow the Creditcardguy on insta and from what I gathered he recommended HDFC Infinia as the ultimate card (for the type of expenses I incur). Although this is a dream card for me, I have been owning Life + with HSBC and OneCard for about a year now. I use them up to the limit (I know this type of usage impacts my credit score) and make partial payments. The worst way of using CCs I guess. Both are LTFs but I want to get a more sensible card and close these as I have not been rewarding with these (in terms of points earned / cash backs for online or offline usage).\n\nI called up my RM at HDFC and she said it‚Äôs wise to not apply for a CC with them when my credit score is below 750, which I understand. My current credit score is as follows:\n\nCIBIL: 658\nExperian: 647\n\nThe worn out score is due to multiple misses on payments (not deliberate but I was careless about  the exact amount I had to maintain for my EMIs to go through) + making minimum payments + using up to 99% limit, also sometimes leading to OD when the assessment charge and a bunch of other fees hit ahead of monthly billing.\n\nI‚Äôm fully capable of repaying my bills but it just can‚Äôt be at once.\n\nMy question to the community is based on my expense category and salary specifics, can I get a good suggestion for my upgrade? Also what card should I aim for (or is this a niche since benefits change with time)? Final one and I‚Äôll shut up; how can I get back to traction with my CIBIL score? I had 756 two months ago. \n\nMy expenditure category is Retail (lifestyle, grocery, quick commerce, fuel and sports related), occasionally at bars/breweries. I also use my CC to draw cash through PhonePe rental (I know this is the worst thing I can do but I need that money at times).\n\nI‚Äôm a 26M residing in BLR, with 1.3L net monthly salary, employed full time currently, spending about 70k (most of it is not active spend but repaying for borrowing on CC from last month). Lounge access required with good all rounder card.\n\nGrateful for your advice!! I promise I‚Äôll gain control just at the tough financial curve of my adult hood.\n",
    "comments": [
      "I hope what I'm saying doesn't come across as rude, but you need a little reality check.\n\n##You are not financially responsible.\n\nBefore you go out and get better cards, you need to become diligent about using credit cards. I cannot fathom why someone earning 1.3L and spending only 70k of it would use max out their credit cards, go past their limits to incur overdraft charges and also withdraw cash using credit cards. And then not pay the bills immediately. \n\nAnd all this while being fully aware of how bad those things are?! I'm gobsmacked! \n\nThe next reality check for you is your credit score. ~650 is a bad score. While getting FD-backed cards are usually what is suggested in these cases, I don't think I can suggest that to someone who uses credit cards this recklessly.\n\nGiven that your primary question is how long you should wait, I'll answer that first, and then give advice. \n\n##Wait 6-12 months.\n\n**Now, the advice**\n\nPay back your credit card bills ASAP. Even if that means no partying for a month or two, do it. Instead of paying back minimum due and racking up interest, pay it all back. If both your cards have dues, and you cannot clear both of them at once, then pay back one of them completely. Ideally, the one that has the higher limit, or the higher bill. Basically, you want to clear the bigger chunk first.\n\nAnd once both the bills are paid fully, stop using your credit cards altogether. Learn discipline. Use your debit card so that you can only spend the money you actually have and so that there's no chance of missing payments. This would also parallelly help in bringing you credit score up.\n\nAt this score, no bank would give you a credit card anyway, so you are not going to be able to acquire a new one until your score gets back up to around 750. When that happens, reassess your expenses, and accordingly get a card.\n\nAlso, don't listen to these financial influencers. They rarely ever mention the downsides or caveats. They only flex the best parts and suppress any information that might dissuade anyone from taking credit cards. Infinia is a farfetched dream for anyone, me included, but especially you and that's not because of its eligibility criteria of 5L monthly income.\n\nI hope you don't take any of this in a wrong way. I am not trying to put you down or anything. This is just unbiased, sound advice that I would have given anyone. And even to you had you asked about credit cards without your recent drop in the credit score or your erratic usage.",
      "At many places you wrote, that you know that you are doing wrong but still you are doing it (like - using full limit, delaying payments, taking out cash). Let me tell you my friend that credit cards are like fire. If you use it carefully and safely you will enjoy the delicious cooked food but if are careless then it will burn you. So first you should make yourself a disciplined user of credit card and then go for any CC. Just a suggestion.",
      "Get a FD backed CC and slowly start making your score better with less than 30% utlisation and timely full payment. Do this for 1-1.5year and only then you will be able to get a decent free card",
      "1. Jot down your Income & your monthly expenses on a piece of paper.  \n2. There should be ZERO discretionary expenses in the above  \n3. Whatever is your monthly saving, in its entirety should go repaying your CC debt  \n4. I can't emphasize this point enough but STOP using any Credit Card till everything is repaid!\n\nTake a hiatus from this sub till then.",
      "Update: I paid up all my CC bills. Would closing the cards as opposed to spending within 30% and repaying them be helpful given the intent to restore my CIBIL? I‚Äôm fine either way, I just want one of y‚Äôall opinion please. Don‚Äôt want to rush here making another costly mistake.",

      "Thank you for the pointers. I‚Äôm working on these right away!",
      "That's great to hear! \n\nIf you feel like you can control your impulses and keep your spends under control, then keeping them would be advisable. Keep usage under 30%, pay all bills in full and never miss payments. That will get you score back up",

      "No tbh cashback card (digital segment) cards depends on doc boy availability as per your pincode. It only requires 30k net even if u dont have cibil score. The retail segment like simply save bpcl reliance is available almost anywhere apart from some remote areas and some negative pincodes. And another thing you dont need a sbi account to process sbi card. Sbi cards has account aggregator fecility which fetches your bank statement. U may get low credit limit but everyone has to start somewhere.",

      "I gave you a suggestion to have a credit card quickly, one may have multiple bank accounts,it's up to you which bank you would use primarily later and let it be active,one or multiple you can manage.\nMy journey started with kotak, if any other bank in which you are interested in having an account and they can provide you cc quickly, you can opt for that, coz I don't know about any other bank regarding your query and can't guarantee that right now kotak also provides quickly like earlier. You have to ask their bank officers for this.",

    "selftext": "i'm new to all of this and kinda confused as to which credit card should I go for (the cc will be issued in my dad's name and then i'll get an addon since I can't get one yet). so the thing is my dad has a regalia gold ltf and literally no other cc. it's all he uses and he doesn't have that spends on credit card either (like 10-20k max in a month). i've been trying to understand credit cards and all to get him to issue a good cashback/rewards card as well so at least I can also use it. I am right now in college and often order everything for home as well as for me online and food deliveries as well mostly from my account only. I often need to travel to and from my college so I'm thinking I can issue an add on regalia for me to get the lounge access. for the rest I'm confused between sbi cashback, hdfc swiggy and airtel axis as to which would benefit me the most. out of 4 my family has 2 airtel sims so I thought airtel axis might help in that situation but it has lower cashback at other spends compared to sbi and swiggy. also is the fd backed one card any good anymore? i've seen a lot of people claim that the rewards on a lot of sites through this card has gone down so would appreciate the perspective of a holder on this card as well.\n\n(also if any card that has good cashback or rewards and also provide railway lounge would be a plus since I often travel by train as well from a station that has a good railway lounge). \n\nthanks",

      "If you are not earning don't use a credit card.\n\nNever use a credit card for rewards and points. \nYou have to learn , how to manage your finances. \nCredit card rewards are added on benefits. Not a way to earn money.\n\nYou better focus on learning stocks and other investments. You will earn more than credit card rewards.\n\n\nI suggest that everyone don't use other credit, especially your parents. You will never understand, how to manage your spending if you do that",
      "i understand your point but I don't blindly spend like that. what happens is Amazon prime, Swiggy One, Zepto Pass etc are on my number so often whatever has to be ordered I am the one who does when my parents tell me to. and for offline purchases my dad uses his regalia. what I meant was to try to get decent enough cashbacks on the online spends I am already doing anyway. so indirectly while I am the one ordering my dad is the one paying anyway since I use his upi/amazon pay balance for all of these purchases.\n\nfor spends done by me all of it is done by upi and tbh the biggest payment on my upi account is like 250-300 and that too because I had to buy medicines when I sick else in everyday spends it's like 20-30 rupees max."

Like a 2.5% interest or something like that. \n\nGenerally when you pay MAD, interest is included in the next statement generated. Since you cleared the outstanding of March, I suspect there is nothing left for you to clear.",

    "selftext": "I got an offer for Axis MyZone credit card and was in the process of applying for it. While selecting the delivery address I realized that my communication address is of the previous city I was in and same was for my work address.\n\nSo I stopped the application and decided to first change my communication address and then apply. Now this happened around 2 weeks ago. To change my current/communication address, they need a proof of my current address which I don't have currently. Now these mfs have been calling me incessantly since the last 2 weeks to 'help' with the application. I get a call every couple of hours during the day.\n\nI usually ignore them, but since it was a holiday yesterday, I picked it up. I told the representative about the address issue and why I was not proceeding with the application. He reassured me that the address can be changed guided me through the application process. \n\nWhen the screen came to choose a delivery address, I told him that I don't stay in that location and I won't be able to receive the card there. He said that there will be an option to change the address and to click on it. But the address could not be changed. I told him this and he seemed to get frustrated.\n\nHe again repeated that there will be a KYC and there I will get the option to choose the delivery address. I repeatedly confirmed this from him. Finally I submitted the application after entering his employee ID. I sadly did not note down his ID anywhere else for my reference.\n\n15 mins later I got a message that my card was approved and I could see the virtual card on the Axis bank app. Now I won't be getting the physical card, and to activate the card I will need the physical card.\n\nWhat struck me was the way the representative was lying through his teeth without any hesitation. After the application he started blabbering about some other offers while I repeatedly told him that I just needed the card over and over. Finally I just kept the call mid sentence. I don't know what pressure they have, but they are some soulless mfs lying without a hint of hesitation.",
