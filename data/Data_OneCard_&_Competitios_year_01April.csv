Journey so far. Need guidance...,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jm2jbz/journey_so_far_need_guidance/,2025-03-28,"Hey folks, I'd appreciate some feedback and actionable steps on how I can better utilise my cards to my spends.

For context : I started a couple of years ago with an FD backed OneCard and lived with it until about a year ago. The rest of my cards came in within the last year.

Monthly expenses approximately range around 5 to 8K
Groceries, food, quick commerce & utility are my typical expense categories.

Currently I hold the following CC (all LTF):
OneCard (Indian Bank) : 20K Limit (Metal Visa and Virtual Rupay)
Amazon ICICI : 80K (Visa)
ICICI Coral : 80K (Rupay) Shared limit I guess
CSB Edge : 20K (Rupay) via Jupiter (salary account)

My current flow is to put utility on the Amazon ICICI card (random coupons for ₹10 - ₹50 off etc).
Edge card (2% cashback on dining enabled) for food delivery, restaurants/bakeries and quick commerce apps.
Coral/Edge rupay cards via Kiwi for merchant purchases (supermarkets, medical stores, books).
OneCard with 0 forex offer for random one off online purchases.

Apay cashback, jupiter jewel and kiwi coins are my main ""rewards"" off of CC. I do not care for lounge access and do not travel much (Two 50km train rides in UR per week at most).

To sum it up, how is my card utility and how can I improve?

My Card Collection/Review,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jcfoyo/my_card_collectionreview/,2025-03-16,"
1. SBI Cashback:
I received it about a week ago. Contrary to what I've read in this sub, this was the easiest application ever. It was approved almost instantly, and I was given a limit of 1.2L.
It offers 5% cashback on all online purchases, which is pretty cool. Though, I don’t want to start spending just because I got this card :p


2. One Card:
I got this about 2 years ago. The metal card sounded cool.
I try to use it for high-risk transactions. Sometime back, I had paid an advance to colive.com. When I went to the property, they told me that the rooms were full and the support asked me to go to a different property. I'm not sure if this can be labelled as a scam but I still reached out to the OneCard support and submitted all the necessary proofs. The transaction was reversed about a month later. This was a while back, so I’m not sure how customer service is now, but I love this card for getting my money back without any hassle.

There are occasional forex offers, which were useful during my Singapore trip. Other wise the rewards are pretty bad.

3. Play:
I used to go to the movies regularly. The 500 Rs monthly off on a 5k spend felt like a good deal, and it was also advertised as free if you're a BMS superstar (which doesn’t exist anymore). I’m planning to close this card since I rarely use these coupons. Sometimes there's a discount on Zepto for RBL Bank cards.


4. Ixigo AU:
This is a forex card. I made a huge mistake by opting for Rupay. If you're planning to use it for foreign trips, please go with Visa. Rupay supposedly partners with Diners, and the customer care told me it should be accepted if the ATM accepts Diners cards, which was complete BS. I tried over 20 ATMs in Singapore and Thailand, Nothing worked. I now use it for all my online international purchases. I also got a priority pass.


5. HDFC Millenia:
I use it for Amazon, Flipkart, and Swiggy Instamart purchases. You get 5% cashback on the first two. Someone on this sub said it applies to the latter as well.


6. Diners Black:
I do not own this card; it's an add-on. My dad got it as LTF a few years ago. This is my default lounge card, No cap on the visits. International lounges inside India allow both the primary card holder and the addon, but Qatar lounge let only one inside ( Either the primary or the addon). I'm not sure if this is the case for other airports as well.
I sometimes use it for domestic flight bookings, but Skyscanner’s flights are almost always 1k cheaper. Swiggy Dineout offers a good instant discount on Diners Black as well.

Also, the 5X rewards on forex loads are super useful, but they expire in March.

7. Airtel Axis:
25% CB upto 250,  I use it for my postpaid bills.
10% cashback on Zomato, Swiggy, and BigBasket up to 500 every month. 10% Cashback upto 250 on my utility bill. I'm saving 1k every month, Solid card.
Extra points for the Axis Bank app.


I think I’m all set. I’ve covered most of my expenses, and I don't even spend a lot.

Need a good LTF/Low fees card that has cashback instead of reward points, to use for daily online and offline txns. 

Just applied for the PopClub CC for UPI. 

Here's the general monthly txn flow. 
KPN/Star Market for fruits, veggies and stuff.

Question about employment status and CCs,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j9p4ov/question_about_employment_status_and_ccs/,2025-03-12,"Hi
I am currently working in a big audit firm. I plan to leave this company in a couple of months. I will be transitioning to working in my (small) family business. I am aware that it is not going to be found in any of the company name drop-down menus in any credit card applications as well. 

My question is that once I switch, how will it affect my ability to get new credit cards and/or upgrade my current credit cards and credit limit. 

Current credit situation:
- ~775 CIBIL score
- HDFC Indian Oil 
- American Express Platinum Travel
- SBI Cashback
- ICICI Amazon Pay
- Auto Loan
- OneCard (closed this month as it was a secured card and I had to break the FD)

If I don't generate a salary slip or anything of that sort, can I still get a new card/card upgrade from my CIBIL score or Experian score, or existing credit cards? 

Will my bank statement be enough to show that I get a regular ""salary"" and display my ability to repay the bill? 

Thank you

Suggestion needed going forward,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j6ds6p/suggestion_needed_going_forward/,2025-03-08,"Hello people

So, i have five credit cards that I used. We only have family credit cards, so these are them . I am mentioning the name below with limit and utilization respectively

Icici rubyx (2L) (1.6L)  
BOB Onecard metal (1L) (85K)  
DBS (30K) (14K)  
RBL supercard (70K) (70K)  
Axis Burgundy (1L) (65K)

Now, due to COVID, our business went kaput but I could still manage the payments and made them regularly. Now, Last year, we shifted and I informed this to all the banks, even KYC updates have been given.

I suffered a life threatening injury last year and had to go into emergency surgery, which drained us of our liquid savings of around 20L. My sister was in the car too and she suffered a hip fracture.

As a result, Both of us are completely unemployed for 1.5 years, till June this year due to recovery. As a result, most of the cards have fallen due.

I have assured them that I have no intention of defrauding them and that I can present my entire medical history and bills to show them my injury is true, but they aren't listening. I offered settlement and got called a choice Indian slur, that I reported to ICICI bank with their agent name.

Now ICICI and Onecard have gone to my old place, and found it locked. They are now saying I am defrauding them and they are suing me for fraud. I told them that they have my KYC, and they know where I live now, Who asked them to go to my empty flat? They are refusing to listen and saying some beautiful slurs about bengalis to me.

Now, I have assets which are in the process of sale to invest and generate passive income, but it is taking a while. I assured them that they can take a bonded sign that I will pay off the entirety when this happens, but slur fest continues.

I have stopped receiving their calls as a result because I have no intention of being insulted left and right despite legit reason and attempt at finding solutions.

How do I proceed forward? CIBIL has taken a hit for both of us, so loans aren't an option 

And yes, before you tell me, I know I shouldn't have used the cards if I can't pay it back. But I hope you never find yourself in a car crash with a fractured spine and 1.5 years of recovery and unemployment. so do be considerate before saying this.","[""I don't really know what to say, brother, just sending some wishes your way.

How long do you recommend I wait?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j2ffg5/how_long_do_you_recommend_i_wait/,2025-03-03,"Hi bros - I’m new to the credit card arena so please forgive me if I’m not making sense anywhere throughout. I follow the Creditcardguy on insta and from what I gathered he recommended HDFC Infinia as the ultimate card (for the type of expenses I incur). Although this is a dream card for me, I have been owning Life + with HSBC and OneCard for about a year now. I use them up to the limit (I know this type of usage impacts my credit score) and make partial payments. The worst way of using CCs I guess. Both are LTFs but I want to get a more sensible card and close these as I have not been rewarding with these (in terms of points earned / cash backs for online or offline usage).

I called up my RM at HDFC and she said it’s wise to not apply for a CC with them when my credit score is below 750, which I understand. My current credit score is as follows:

CIBIL: 658
Experian: 647

The worn out score is due to multiple misses on payments (not deliberate but I was careless about  the exact amount I had to maintain for my EMIs to go through) + making minimum payments + using up to 99% limit, also sometimes leading to OD when the assessment charge and a bunch of other fees hit ahead of monthly billing.

I’m fully capable of repaying my bills but it just can’t be at once.

My question to the community is based on my expense category and salary specifics, can I get a good suggestion for my upgrade? Also what card should I aim for (or is this a niche since benefits change with time)? Final one and I’ll shut up; how can I get back to traction with my CIBIL score? I had 756 two months ago. 

My expenditure category is Retail (lifestyle, grocery, quick commerce, fuel and sports related), occasionally at bars/breweries. I also use my CC to draw cash through PhonePe rental (I know this is the worst thing I can do but I need that money at times).

I’m a 26M residing in BLR, with 1.3L net monthly salary, employed full time currently, spending about 70k (most of it is not active spend but repaying for borrowing on CC from last month). Lounge access required with good all rounder card.

Grateful for your advice!! I promise I’ll gain control just at the tough financial curve of my adult hood.
","[""I hope what I'm saying doesn't come across as rude, but you need a little reality check.\n\n##You are not financially responsible.\n\nBefore you go out and get better cards, you need to become diligent about using credit cards. I cannot fathom why someone earning 1.3L and spending only 70k of it would use max out their credit cards, go past their limits to incur overdraft charges and also withdraw cash using credit cards. And then not pay the bills immediately. \n\nAnd all this while being fully aware of how bad those things are?! I'm gobsmacked! \n\nThe next reality check for you is your credit score. ~650 is a bad score. While getting FD-backed cards are usually what is suggested in these cases, I don't think I can suggest that to someone who uses credit cards this recklessly.\n\nGiven that your primary question is how long you should wait, I'll answer that first, and then give advice. \n\n##Wait 6-12 months.\n\n**Now, the advice**\n\nPay back your credit card bills ASAP. Even if that means no partying for a month or two, do it. Instead of paying back minimum due and racking up interest, pay it all back. If both your cards have dues, and you cannot clear both of them at once, then pay back one of them completely. Ideally, the one that has the higher limit, or the higher bill. Basically, you want to clear the bigger chunk first.\n\nAnd once both the bills are paid fully, stop using your credit cards altogether. Learn discipline. Use your debit card so that you can only spend the money you actually have and so that there's no chance of missing payments. This would also parallelly help in bringing you credit score up.\n\nAt this score, no bank would give you a credit card anyway, so you are not going to be able to acquire a new one until your score gets back up to around 750. When that happens, reassess your expenses, and accordingly get a card.\n\nAlso, don't listen to these financial influencers. They rarely ever mention the downsides or caveats. They only flex the best parts and suppress any information that might dissuade anyone from taking credit cards. Infinia is a farfetched dream for anyone, me included, but especially you and that's not because of its eligibility criteria of 5L monthly income.\n\nI hope you don't take any of this in a wrong way. I am not trying to put you down or anything. This is just unbiased, sound advice that I would have given anyone. And even to you had you asked about credit cards without your recent drop in the credit score or your erratic usage."", 'At many places you wrote, that you know that you are doing wrong but still you are doing it (like - using full limit, delaying payments, taking out cash).

So first you should make yourself a disciplined user of credit card and then go for any CC.

There should be ZERO discretionary expenses in the above  \n3. Whatever is your monthly saving, in its entirety should go repaying your CC debt  \n4.

last year around December when tata neu plus was offered as ltf I applied for it on HDFC site it was my first credit card application and obviously got rejected, then applied for one card (BOB card) they hold my application for around 1-1.5 months and kept saying they are adding new kyc methods and later it also got rejected now in March there was kiosk from icici and hdfc bank to open salary account there I opened an icici account(not any perticular reason to go for icici its just that thier service experience is great and there branch is in my office building itself) and they also filled a credit card application for thier basic ltf platinum card I was really hoping that atleast now I will get it and got rejected here too.

which credit card to pick??,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jnxhvi/which_credit_card_to_pick/,2025-03-31,"i'm new to all of this and kinda confused as to which credit card should I go for (the cc will be issued in my dad's name and then i'll get an addon since I can't get one yet). so the thing is my dad has a regalia gold ltf and literally no other cc. it's all he uses and he doesn't have that spends on credit card either (like 10-20k max in a month). i've been trying to understand credit cards and all to get him to issue a good cashback/rewards card as well so at least I can also use it. I am right now in college and often order everything for home as well as for me online and food deliveries as well mostly from my account only. I often need to travel to and from my college so I'm thinking I can issue an add on regalia for me to get the lounge access. for the rest I'm confused between sbi cashback, hdfc swiggy and airtel axis as to which would benefit me the most. out of 4 my family has 2 airtel sims so I thought airtel axis might help in that situation but it has lower cashback at other spends compared to sbi and swiggy. also is the fd backed one card any good anymore? i've seen a lot of people claim that the rewards on a lot of sites through this card has gone down so would appreciate the perspective of a holder on this card as well.

(also if any card that has good cashback or rewards and also provide railway lounge would be a plus since I often travel by train as well from a station that has a good railway lounge).

While selecting the delivery address I realized that my communication address is of the previous city I was in and same was for my work address.

So I stopped the application and decided to first change my communication address and then apply. Now this happened around 2 weeks ago. To change my current/communication address, they need a proof of my current address which I don't have currently. Now these mfs have been calling me incessantly since the last 2 weeks to 'help' with the application. I get a call every couple of hours during the day.

I usually ignore them, but since it was a holiday yesterday, I picked it up. I told the representative about the address issue and why I was not proceeding with the application. He reassured me that the address can be changed guided me through the application process. 

When the screen came to choose a delivery address, I told him that I don't stay in that location and I won't be able to receive the card there. He said that there will be an option to change the address and to click on it. But the address could not be changed. I told him this and he seemed to get frustrated.

He again repeated that there will be a KYC and there I will get the option to choose the delivery address. I repeatedly confirmed this from him. Finally I submitted the application after entering his employee ID. I sadly did not note down his ID anywhere else for my reference.

15 mins later I got a message that my card was approved and I could see the virtual card on the Axis bank app. Now I won't be getting the physical card, and to activate the card I will need the physical card.

What struck me was the way the representative was lying through his teeth without any hesitation. After the application he started blabbering about some other offers while I repeatedly told him that I just needed the card over and over. Finally I just kept the call mid sentence. I don't know what pressure they have, but they are some soulless mfs lying without a hint of hesitation.","[""They get incentives for every Application. They don't care about us. As simple as that.

Which cards to chuck vs retain?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jftyab/which_cards_to_chuck_vs_retain/,2025-03-20,"Hello everyone. I have been a lurker here for a long time and have read many posts here to understand if I can figure out my needs. I have been using credit cards since 2011 and I have quiet a few(one too many in my opinion). Before I begin let me give my details:

* Current Cibil: 790
* Age: 38
* Monthly Income and Employment status: Salaried, 2.7 Lakhs per month takehome.
* Monthly Expenses & Spending Patterns: EMIs for an old personal loan, Rent, Swiggy, Fuel, Bills, Not too much left to invest other than NPS via salary and some SIP's.
* Top 5 Monthly spend categories and Top 5 Annual spend categories: Rent, Travel, 
* Preferences for Credit Card Features: Need travel benefits as I am travelling a lot for work and otherwise.
* Reward Preference (Cashback or Reward Points): Agnostic as I have a mix of both in my current portfolio
* Lounge Access Required: Not really as I find BOM T2 and DEL T3(my most frequented) lounges to be jam packed almost always!
* Other Special Needs: Fuel/Utility bills

Below are the cards I already have:

* Citi Premier, now Axis Horizon - Used to keep it for travel points conversion
* HDFC Regalia Gold - Use now only for lounge
* HDFC Tata Neu Infinity - Use to book Taj hotels
* HDFC Swiggy LTF - Swiggy usage on a daily basis
* SBI Elite - Rarely use, keeping it for the 2 tickets/500 free monthly
* SBI BPCL Octane - Fuel spends reward points
* ICICI Amazonpay - Use rarely now as most shopping is now one/two times a year
* ICICI AdaniOne Siganture - Use for travel bookings/Lounge
* Kotak PVR - Movie tickets

I also used to have a Zomato/RBL card which is now discontinued and a Slice Card which is also now discontinued. The AdaniOne, Neu and Swiggy cards were added in previous 6 months.

I want suggestions to reduce my cards as I see there are few which are not kept in my wallet and I hardly use them. My main usage is for hotels for work travel which I pay and later reimburse from my company. Usually 6-10 nights a month at 10-12k per night is usually spent by me. I currently use Tata Neu to book Taj hotels when they are in my budget(which off late is not many). I also used AdaniOne, Agoda, [Hotels.com](http://Hotels.com) but the benefits were not that great because I get better benefits when I book direct on [marriot.com](http://marriot.com) or [accor.com](http://accor.com) or clubitc.com. Other than this the other spend is on fuel, occasional shopping on Myntra/Amazon. I also do a bit of personal travel when I do book hotels but these are usually 5-10 days a year. Should I continue this? If so which card should I use in the hotel payments to maximise my rewards/cash back?  
  
I have never used HDFC Smartbuy to book hotels, but I have heard about it on this sub, same for Axis' portal. Should I switch to those? I had converted my HDFC points to marriot points and had a great deal last year end when I did a gift card purchase from HDFC Smartbuy for marriot points.   
  
I use swiggy on a daily basis for 200-300 rupees and I found HDFC Swiggy card to be great. Kotak PVR has been a mix with some surprise cashback and not really much otherwise. The Tata Neu card is great for Taj/Air India bookings, but other than that I don't see much value for this. The UPI payments for small payments is a good usecase for the card, but some vendors have stopped using this.

My monthly rent is 45k and I wanna know if I can use any cards to still pay rent. I stopped using CC for rent about 2 years ago when the banks started charging for rent payments. I wanna know if still things are same or is there any benefit for rent payment via cards?

I also have a school fee payment for my kid of 1.65-1.75 lakh per annum as of now. Currently it is direct transfer to school. Can I do this through any CC to gain anything?

I also have small utility bills of 1-1.2k on power and 1.2k on phone+data per month, should I get a Airtel card for this? 

I have never tried AMEX in my life, should I jump into that bandwagon? I had asked my HDFC RM for a infinia card and  got denied about 2 years ago with a lower salary, should I check again?

Sorry for the very long multi-question enquiry. Hope the experts here can help me to optimise my card strategy!","['You sir need a detailed answer. Give me a day to process this information', 'No takers?']",slice

--------------------------------------------

A background on credit history:
- Never had a credit card
- Have used PayLater apps (Simpl, LazyPay) here and there
- Used Slice for ~35k once and I have a limit of ~40k currently
- Have a 30k Amazon PayLater limit but never used it
- My CIBIL score has not been generated yet

-----------------------------------------------------

Here's a breakdown of the struggle I've gone through in the last week:

- I have an HDFC account, I tried to apply for a credit card online but their form had a glitch that only accepts work emails ending in .com or .in and my work email was not being accepted.

- I tried calling the TeleAssist number but the operators would pick up the call but no one would say anything while I could here the people talking in the back lol

- Since they weren't picking I tried other options
1. Went to PaisaBazaar to find the right Credit Card, shortlisted Millennia and Moneyback+
2. Applied for ICICI credit cards as some friends of mine had got one with a limit of 50k through a stall in our college an year back, but they rejected my application
3. Filled the form for Banzaz Finserv EMI Card, they also rejected 
4. Tried some other apps like Slice but they rejected me, only one of them approved but they gave me a limit of 5k lol


Then,
- When the HDFC TeleAssist operator finally talked to me, the operator filled the form for me and I got the link to upload documents like salary slips and other details and I got an application reference number.

- Right after filling the form I tried to track the status and it said (you can guess) - REJECTED (and they haven't picked up my call since, the same things happens, they pick up and no one answers even though I can clearly hear people on the other side)

NOTE:
I have googled and struggled and nothing seems to work and my CIBIL login shows no records of the PayLater usage as well as the Slice usage

I also feel that so many requests and applications and Credit History checks on my PAN in a short time have flagged me as credit-desperate and that's making it worse.

I've been using credit cards since 2022. My credit journey began with a Slice BNPL card, which wasn’t a true credit card. Initially, it had a limit of ₹10k, but now the borrowing limit has increased to ₹1.24 lakh. Later, I was offered an ICICI Coral Visa card (₹60k limit) since I had a savings account with ICICI. They also gave me a Coral Rupay card with a shared limit.

Recently, I made a mistake by getting the HDFC Swiggy card instead of a core card and then added a Tata Neu Plus card (shared limit of ₹50k for both). Last week, I applied for an Amazon Pay ICICI card and got it with a separate limit of ₹60k. All three cards (Amazon Pay ICICI, Swiggy, and Tata Neu Plus) are lifetime free (LTF).

In reality, I would love to get the HDFC Millennia card, but people say it’s tough to get after having co-branded cards. Many suggest applying for the HDFC Freedom card first and then upgrading it to Millennia later. I see people applying for the Freedom card via Paytm – should I go for that? Is that the right approach?

I also feel the need for a core SBI card if so which one to go for.... Additionally, I’ve been hearing a lot about Kiwi Credit – is it worth getting?

My CIBIL score was 780 but recently dropped to 776 due to 4 hard inquiries. Is my card mix good, or should I make changes? Any advice would be helpful.

TL;DR: 23M earning ₹66k/month. Current cards: Slice (BNPL, ₹1.24 lakh limit), ICICI Coral Visa (₹60k), Coral Rupay (shared limit), HDFC Swiggy + Tata Neu Plus (shared ₹50k, both LTF), Amazon Pay ICICI (₹60k, LTF). Would love HDFC Millennia but heard it’s tough after co-branded cards; is getting hdfc Freedom first via paytm, then upgrading to Millennia, a good approach?

Help me in optimising my credit card collection.,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1gz9zdb/help_me_in_optimising_my_credit_card_collection/,2024-11-25,"https://preview.redd.it/ssjqc4cezy2e1.jpg?width=1939&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a58177711dc54b34afd65f16c0d6fa22dceb950

Friends, these are the credit/debit cards I currently use, and I select them for usage based on the following criteria:

* **Fuel**: SBI BPCL
* **Flipkart**: HDFC Millennia (I canceled Axis Flipkart after getting Millennia due to its ₹500 annual fee.)
* **Amazon**: Amazon Pay ICICI
* **BookMyShow**: IDFC WOW (FD-backed card)
* **Paytm Movies/TicketNew**: Axis MyZone
* **Tata Websites**: Tata NeuCard
* **UPI**: Slice/Federal Bank Wave/SBI

# Key Concerns

1. The remaining cards are not being used much.
2. Suggest the best card for **utility payments** (bills/recharges) from my collection or recommend a better one.
3. Recommend the best card for **UPI transactions** and **Offline swipe payments**.

# About IDFC WOW

This card is secured against a ₹10,000 FD and is used exclusively for BookMyShow offers. Should I close the FD and get a better card instead?

# About HDFC Millennia

Millennia is the only card with an annual fee (₹1,000). All the other cards are lifetime free (LTF). I switched to Millennia during the Big Billion Days as it offered better deals than Axis Flipkart at the time. However, I don’t see many offers now.

* How can I optimize the use of Millennia?
* Which cards from my collection should I close?

Hey everyone,  
I have a **CIBIL score of 785** and am looking for a second credit card recommendation. I currently have the **Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card** (limit: ₹70,000) and **Amazon Pay Later**. No other active credit cards or loans at the moment.

# My Credit Card History:

* **Slice Pay**: First card, ₹56,000 limit, but not recognized by CIBIL. Closed, no longer in use.
* **Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card**: Been using this card for 3+ years with good benefits and rewards.
* **Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card**: I had this for about a year, but the experience wasn’t great. The annual fee, Flipkart branding, and slow cashback frustrated me. I closed it last month, but it’s not reflected in my CIBIL report yet.

# Current Credit Situation:

I've **closed most of my unsecured loans** and personal loans, including the **Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card**, so my credit profile is now clean and simple.

I’m looking for a **Lifetime Free (LTF)** second credit card with decent rewards, preferably with no annual fee.

Think about this: your card has lounge access but you need to spend 50k to get that access-and how much is that lounge access even worth? 500-1550? Is it even worth spending that extra 10-15k to get benefits of 500? 

This was the not-so-serious part of the question, now, talking about talking about taking EMIs for your friends, just so that they can get discounts, is a risky job. Trust me, I've been there and I almost got fucked royally. Long story short, friend asked for card because 0 cost emi discount < promised to pay in installments < friend missed 2 payments < I paid the installments < I asked for money < friend returned money after saying: ""Bhai tere liye paisa hee sab kuch hai"" < friend no longer friend. I disagree with Dave Ramsey on a lot of things but his statement of ""your friend is no longer a friend if you lend him money"", I agree with that completely. Heck, if a friend asks for money, I give it without me expecting it back. Money is a lot more psychological than you think, and more often than not, it breaks relationships.

I’d really appreciate your insights on this credit card. I’ve done some research, but only found a few user reviews online so far. My main hesitation is that it’s a partnership with UNI—I’m generally not a fan of FinTechs like UNI and Slice. However, I am looking for a lifetime-free card with a 0% forex markup for future use. Here’s what I’ve considered so far:

1. AU Ixigo: The application process seems tough, and my home PIN isn’t serviceable. Not sure if my work PIN is covered, and I’m currently in WFH mode.

2. Federal Bank Scapia: I’ve heard onboarding has been paused. Also, I’d prefer a core Federal Bank card, so I’m skipping this one.

My Current Cards:

1. Amazon Pay ICICI

2. Axis Flipkart & Axis Neo (Rupay)

3. HDFC Millenia

4. SBI SimplyClick

Recent Inquiries (last month):

1. ICICI: Tried for the LTF Coral Rupay, hoping it would complement my Amazon Pay ICICI for ICICI-specific offers—request was denied.

2. HDFC: Applied for the Swiggy HDFC Card (still in process).

3. SBI: For SBI SimplyClick.

4. Axis: Requested a limit enhancement.

If anyone is using this card, could you share your experience with it, including the application process? I’d also like to know if you get to choose your preferred bank, network, etc.

From debt trap to understanding cc usage,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1g52qn6/from_debt_trap_to_understanding_cc_usage/,2024-10-16,"
I started using bnpl service mainly simpl 5 yrs back. I just turned 18, I was very amature. I loved to blow that account to max and didn't use to pay them for months but still I cleared that as it was a very small amount. I was lucky that they didn't report to credit beaure. 

When I turned 19 I accidentally applied for Flipkart bnpl which started my cibil and I didn't know that luckily I didn't do the mistake of using it for unnecessary purchase. The same year I enrolled in college and got my first credit card slice student card via college id.

I always maxed out the card during my college years and used to pay the emi on time and then take money from it back and forth for years. I used to pay emi and take that money back in my account.

Then at age 20 I got my first credit card hdfc moneyback+ and luckily at time I understood what is credit utilisation as I didn't blew that card as the limit was really good but as I was in college I had aspirations and as my slice card was max out I used to take cc loans from that card but credit utilisation didn't go above 50% and the main reason was spending on food. 

At age 21 i got another card if kotak and leaned that cards are ltf and it was great.so all those years of my college being over I had a debt of around 80k and for 2 years I was just using slice to pay emi and take back the new amount.

So when I was 22 I started to learn about finance I took a personal loan from hdfc at just 12 % and made a emi which was just under my allowance. I used to pay extra emi for that loan and I paid that debt in 2 yrs am not working and it was all my monthly allowance that I used to pay.

Currently I have a cibil of 776 card usage under 20% and have some good cc.

My key insight is take a cc when you are young so that the mess you create would be manageable as I didn't got any pocket money before I turned 18. So I had no idea how to use it properly and the thing is I have heard all these things on internet earlier but when I got into the trap I realised wtf I can't order from Zomato today because I won't have money to pay for my cc. I never believed in taking loans from friend or I would have f***ed up more.

So that's all I hope you can understand my story and know how use your cc wisely.","[""I'm surprised banks are freely giving them to students, I know many employed people facing rejections for basic CCs"", ""Once you build a good cibil there's low chances for rejection.""]",slice

A Journey of ~10 Years,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1fsazp6/a_journey_of_10_years/,2024-09-29,"

Now that I've got your attention with my rather impressive collection, read on!

I've been a credit card enthusiast since 2015, and over the years, I've reaped the rewards—vacations, freebies, and even social status and bragging rights :P. But I've also learned a few valuable lessons along the way, which I felt was important to share:

1. Too Many Cards is Overwhelming & Unsustainable

Managing more than 10 cards and trying to over-optimize rewards on each one can turn into a part-time job. Credit cards should be a convenience, not a hassle.

2. All Good Things Must Come to an End

If a credit card sounds too good to be true, it probably is. DCB and Magnus eventually got devalued. Exploit them while it lasts, but don’t bank on them sticking around for long.

3. Rewards is not “Savings”

Spending more can get you cashbacks, points, or vouchers, which might seem like savings, but they’re not. Real savings come from spending less. 
INR 2L in investments/savings always beats 2L credit card points.

4. “There’s Always Gonna Be Another Mountain”

Top-Tier cards won’t bring lasting happiness. I chased after the Infinia card for years, and when I finally got it, I immediately started eyeing the next better card. High-end cards can be exciting and mysterious because of their exclusivity and perks, but they won’t fill any deep voids.

5. There are no Free Lunches

People who take luxury vacations and first-class flights using points either spend a TON on their cards or have jobs where work-related travel and expenses are reimbursed by their companies. Trying to match their spending to chase your free vacation paid with points can lead to financial disaster.

6. Your Credit Limit is Not your Spending Power

A high credit limit not a license to spend beyond your means. This growing trend of millennials and Gen-Z maxing out their cards and being unable to payback is concerning. A credit debt trap can wipe out your financial freedom and mental peace. Your spending power is at most your salary/income.

7. Beware of No-Cost EMIs

Big-ticket purchases on EMI can psychologically trick you into forgetting how much you’re actually spending. I’ve seen my friends end up in an EMI pile-up, lose track of multiple EMIs across multiple cards, and their entire credit limits being maxed out from the outstanding balances. A good rule of thumb: limit yourself to one active EMI across all cards at any given time.

What are your thoughts on lenders like One card and Slice ,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1f0thch/what_are_your_thoughts_on_lenders_like_one_card/,2024-08-25,"Hello fellow redditors, I(19M) was thinking of getting a credit card of my own i don't have any income and credit history so its difficult to get a credit card from traditional banks. So i thought of giving a try to these fintech lenders like Slice, One card, cred and Fi money.

I don't know anything about them how they work what are their conditions and what do they charge so some of my questions are 

1. Do they have an interest free period like traditional credit cards 
2. What are their eligibility criteria 
3. What are their transaction fees criteria 
4. It is good to use for a student 
5. Are they LTF
6. And most importantly are their any hidden charges 

Please let me know about these things and do suggest some LTF credit cards. ","[""Get a FD based card from IDFC, the Wow one. It's a bank, don't rely on fintechs, if you want, I would just suggest onecard as they seem to be a bit more trustworthy to me than all these like cred, slice etc.\n\n>1. Do they have an interest free period like traditional credit cards \n\nLol why would they even call them credit card if they did not. Yes, they do have it. So my sons IDFC wow statement is generated on the 17th or something every month and gets until the 2nd or 3rd of the next month to pay it off.\n\n>What are their eligibility criteria \n\nNot sure about the others but for IDFC and onecard, I think a minimum FD of 10k is required against which you'll get a credit limit, like if you do a 10k FD, you'll get 10k limit on your card.\n\n>What are their transaction fees criteria \n\nThere are never any transaction fees for the users, they are levied to the merchants.\n\nIf you mean card membership fee or something, then idfc and onecard are lifetime free. \n\n>It is good to use for a student\nYes, it builds a credit score since you're a new adult which can help while getting any type of credit when you need it in the future plus you start becoming more responsible with your money.\n\n>And most importantly are their any hidden charges \n\nNope. If any, there are some charges if you take EMI, like 199rs plus GST when you opt for emi while transacting."", ""Slice doesn't issue credit cards, they now issue personal loans under very scammy terms.

How I Escaped the Credit Card Debt Trap in 2015,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1db2eb0/how_i_escaped_the_credit_card_debt_trap_in_2015/,2024-06-08,"Back in 2015, I found myself in a vicious cycle of credit card debt, and I wanted to share my story in hopes it might help someone in a similar situation.

**The Beginning of the Debt Trap**

My journey into debt started with impulse purchases and a lack of understanding about my credit limit relative to my income. I made the classic mistake of only paying the minimum amount due each month, not realizing how quickly interest was compounding and how it was setting me up for financial disaster.

**Living with Debt**

Living with the constant stress of mounting debt was incredibly difficult. Every basic expenditure became a source of anxiety. I was always nervous about calls from recovery agents and often found myself dodging their calls. It felt like I was trapped in a never-ending cycle with no way out.

**The Turning Point**

After struggling for over a year, I finally decided to call the bank and request some extra time to make payments. It was during this period that I realized I could take a personal loan to pay off the credit card debt. This was a game-changer for me. I took a personal loan of about 1.3 lacs INR with a repayment tenure of 18 months. The interest rate on the personal loan was significantly lower than the credit card interest rate, making the repayments much more manageable.

**The Road to Recovery**

Paying off the credit card debt brought an immense sense of relief and happiness. I knew I could handle the personal loan repayments without any problem. After 18 months, I felt over the moon having cleared the debt. However, my CIBIL score had taken a major hit and was around 500.

To rebuild my credit score, I took a Slice credit card with a modest limit of about 5000 INR and used it responsibly. Slowly but surely, my credit score began to improve. Today, my CIBIL score is around 795, and I have access to almost any credit card I want. This journey from financial despair to stability has been incredibly rewarding.

**Lessons Learned and Advice**

From this experience, I learned several important lessons:

1. **Never Overspend on a Credit Card**: Always be mindful of your spending and ensure it aligns with your ability to repay the full bill each month.
2. **Pay the Total Bill Due**: Avoid paying just the minimum amount to prevent falling into a debt trap.
3. **Consider Personal Loans for Debt Repayment**: If you're struggling with credit card debt, a personal loan can be a much cheaper option due to its lower interest rates.
4. **Don't Panic**: It’s crucial to stay calm, make a plan, and follow through with it. Financial stress can be overwhelming, but a structured approach can help you regain control.

If you're currently facing a similar situation, know that it's possible to overcome it with the right strategies and mindset. Take it one step at a time, seek help when needed, and stay disciplined in your financial practices.

Hdfc Regilia - first cc, LTF. Kept only for offers. Since other hdfc cc don’t work on amazon,Flipkart.

Hdfc Tataneu - LTF, Usally using for daily small upi transactions. Gets rewards on cred, Rewards on rupay spends milestone, some tataneu coins.

Hdfc Swiggy - LTF ( I order via swiggy but not much. Kept for combining with girf deals + 5% off + coupon code + 10% cb ). Paid around ₹2200 for 5k bill. Less usage but great impact.

Sbi Cashback - Less usage but usally for online spends and covers up the cc charges anually.

Sbi Simplysave - Kept for online shopping offers. Sometimes used by me or I provide it to friends for offers while keeping some money as off for me so makes up the yearly fees.

Axis Kiwi - LTF,  Just got because of Upi hype
Axis Myzone - LTF,  Kept just in case I go for movies. Has 1+1 offers.

Have Lazypay, Simpl, Amazon paylater, Slice . Kept just for offers since free.

Best way to increase CL on SBI CB Card,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1cn18bp/best_way_to_increase_cl_on_sbi_cb_card/,2024-05-08,"I've had this card for over a year and half now. My CL is still the 10K they gave at the start, which was abysmal for my income.
But I thought they'll increase it because it's my first actual credit card. Before it I used slice, and thay helped me with my Credit History.


Only way to use this card was to make a purchase and immediately pay off most of it, so as to keep my utilisation under 30%. But again I was never able to purchase anything of price more than 10K.




I've applied to some other cards from ICICI and got 1L limit, which is much more appropriate to my income and my credit score. My CIBIl has always been in 750-800 range (currently 780). 
During the first year of card, I applied for CL increase, gave all the documentation and then got rejected due to ""internal policies"", and then have to wait for three months. Waited three months, applied again, denied again. REPEAT. I've raised request to nodal officers as well but to no avail.




So what's the best way to increase it. Should I put cancellation request sighting low CL as a reason?

","['I got the SBI Cashback card in early 2023 with a limit of 20k (my other cards have limits above 5L). I kept asking for a credit limit increase, but they were not even ready to take a request for it. \n\nFinally after a year or so, late March, I emailed them saying, either you take a request for credit limit increase or close the card as 20k is too less for me. They then asked me to send proof of income (payslips, bank statements etc), which I did. Then they said the request would be processed within 3 weeks (not sure why they need so much time)\n\nAfter not getting any further communication within the promised date, I thought I’d  need to follow up again and opened the SBI app to take a screenshot. \nSurprisingly the limit was already increased but there was zero notification. Present limit is around 3L, still not as much as my other cards but way better than the initial 20k. \n\nSo maybe continuously email them asking for a CL increase.', '[deleted]', ""I e-mailed them after every three months (you can't apply again for 3 months once rejected)\nThey asked for proof of income each time, which frustrated me a lot because they don't consider payslips and want bank statements, which are a hassle to arrange for the whole 3 months.\n\nAnd after doing all that hassle I get rejected again."", 'What is the email you used to file the grievance?', ""I've been using this card for one and a half years. Instead of giving me an upgrade offer, they're even denying my requests.\n\nWhat breaks my heart even more is that my friend who earns the same as me applied to this card after me, and got a 1 Lakh limit.\n\n\nI even asked the nodal officer what they expect me to do to fit into their policies. Should I keep the total usage under 30%, should I spend as much as I can while prepaying most of it to keep it under 30%, should I keep my utilisation as high as possible or should I just stop using this card for some while.\nBut all I got was the same pre-written generic answers."", ""I had went through the escalation flow back in mid 2023 I think, but they just replied with standard boiler plate saying it's bank's internal policies etc. \n\nThe recent interaction where the limit got increased was with customercare@sbicard.com."", 'Thanks, will try my luck again.']",slice

All about HDFC Pixel Card - an unnecessarily hated card ?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1josd1v/all_about_hdfc_pixel_card_an_unnecessarily_hated/,2025-04-01,"I've noticed that many people don't like the Pixel card, but I feel differently, so let's explore whether it could be beneficial for you too.

In this discussion, I will cover the HDFC Pixel Play card (the Pixel Go is similar, with the exception of the 5% and 3% categories).

• Category - Cashback
• Select Visa + Rupay version for best optimization. (Visa physical and Rupay Virtual)

💳 1) Joining/Annual fees - Offered Lifetime free from 1st Dec 2024.
• Applications can only be submitted via the Payzapp app and are typically approved with ease.

 🎁 2) Cashback Structure 
     A} 5 percent Cashback on any 2 packs you choose i.e 4 merchants (listed below).
1st pack ] Dining & Entertainment – Bookmyshow & Zomato.
2nd pack ] Travel – MakeMyTrip & Uber.
3rd pack ] Grocery – Blinkit & Reliance Smart Bazaar.
4th pack ] Electronics Category – Croma & Reliance Digital.
5th pack ] Fashion Category – Nykaa & Myntra.

B} 5 percent Cashback on the Smartbuy platform - accessible through the Shop segment of the Payzapp app or directly via the Smartbuy website.
SmartBuy under categories IGP, Flights, Hotels, Bus, Rail, Instant Vouchers, Apple Imagine Tresor. Yes on train bookings it gives 5 percent cashback. (Even Regalia Gold doesn't provide 5 percent value back on train bookings.)

C} 3 percent cashback on any one e-commerce platform - Amazon, Flipkart, or Payzapp.

D} Get 10 percent cashback on food and dining, applicable via direct scan and pay using UPI on the credit card (this is an introductory offer and might be discontinued later, but it's definitely the best feature among all).
Additionally, while Payzapp highlights food and dining, the terms and conditions only mention dining; I have successfully received cashback in the food category as well.

E} 1 percent cashback offered on all other UPI transactions. Transactions that are not eligible for cashback include fuel purchases, wallet transactions, rent payments, government-related transactions, and EMI payments. Unlike Tata Neu, this option is not restricted to PayZapp and can be utilized through other applications.
The best choice would be the Kiwi app, as it also provides an additional cashback of 0.2 to 1.5 percent or super money. This is the optimal combination if you do not possess a Kiwi credit card. (I do not have a Kiwi card because it is unable to fetch my CIBIL score; I'm not sure why.)

F} 1% unlimited cashback on other expenses. Categories excluded are same as above.

🔴 3) Cashpoint capping and Validity  
All cashback is provided in the form of Cashpoints.
1 Cashpoint = 1 rupees. A minimum of 1000 Cashpoints is required to redeem. (No redemption fee applies)  
Capping limits (applicable each calendar month)  
Category A - 500 Cashpoints across a total of 4 merchants.  
Category B - 500 Cashpoints throughout smartbuy (SB)  
Category C - 500 Cashpoints any one e-commerce
Category D - 500 Cashpoints, but each transaction is capped at 250.  
Category E - 500 Cashpoints across UPI.  
Category F - Unlimited  
• All Cashpoints remain valid for 2 years from the date they are credited.

⛽ 4) Waiver on fuel surcharge - 1 percent for transactions ranging from 400 to 5000, capped at 250rs per statement cycle.  

• No milestone rewards or lounge access provided.

Here are two key points to remember:  
First, if you hold any other HDFC card, you’ll need to divide the credit limit and transfer it to your Pixel card from the existing HDFC card.  
Second, the PayZapp support team is not very helpful.  
Even for straightforward issues, their response time can take up to two days, and sometimes they don’t reply at all, although I haven't encountered that situation; I got to know this from the Technofino community.

Conclusion:
Given the simplicity of obtaining this card and the fact that it's a lifetime free card, it is an excellent choice for beginners or even for Pros if their needs align with the following 3 points: 

1st) A 10% cashback on food and dining transactions made directly via UPI—ideal for those who frequent restaurants that are not associated with popular dining platforms like Easydiner or Swiggy Dinout (yes, I've even received 10% cashpoints at a samosa and litti shop when the merchant utilized the food MCC). 

2nd) A 5% cashback on train bookings through SB (only premium cards or IRCTC co-branded cards offer this level of rewards on train bookings). 

3rd) UPI transactions if you don't possess a Kiwi card. By using the Kiwi app with the Pixel card, you can earn an overall cashback ranging from 1.2% to 2.5%. (I dislike the Tata Neu card because it's restricted to the Tata Neu app, and their Neu Coin system is shit and the app is laggy.)

Personal experience:  
I received this card on March 19, 2025, and in the 12 days since then, I have earned 762 Cashpoints from approximately 14,000 in spending. This shows the rewards rate of approx 5.4 percent. 
I use this card to book train tickets, pay for food and dining, and conduct UPI transactions, and given that it’s a lifetime free card, I find this rate to be quite impressive. 

While many people dislike this card, it has been offering me excellent cashback, so ultimately, my advice would be to refrain from choosing a card based solely on others' opinion. firstly analyse your spends and determine which card would be most beneficial for YOUR SPENDS.

Which card should I add next?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jngmyx/which_card_should_i_add_next/,2025-03-30,"I currently own the following cards:

1. Airtel axis - all recharges, utilitiy payments (EB, Gas, broadband)

2. Amazon Icici - for amazon purchases. i rarely buy from flipkart.

3. Hdfc Millenia (paid version) - for any other online transactions and emi

4. Kotak PVR - just hit 15k with fuel or other misc non rewarding spends for 2 movie tickets a month. 

  
I got Airtel axis recently. Last financial year my usage has been as follows:

1. Amazon icici - 2.5L

2. HDFC millenia - 5L

3. Kotak PVR - 1.5L

  
What next card, if any, should I get next?  

Most of my grocery spends are through ARMY CSD, and all veggies or organics are offline stores only. I don't use blinkit or zepto. My spends are mostly POS, online based only. 

  
1, Any Rupay card  ? -> I don't find value in those the more I research. And subscription cards like Kiwi is just another hassle to maintain

2, Axis atlas - I pretty much don't travel other than 3 train trips to my home town. So, i'm not sure if I can maximise this card. 

3. Any AMEX - again, this would suit my spending pattern. but with the now announced devaluation for amex plat travel and upcoming amex mrcc devaluation, would it be worth considering?

Journey so far. Need guidance...,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jm2jbz/journey_so_far_need_guidance/,2025-03-28,"Hey folks, I'd appreciate some feedback and actionable steps on how I can better utilise my cards to my spends.

For context : I started a couple of years ago with an FD backed OneCard and lived with it until about a year ago. The rest of my cards came in within the last year.

Monthly expenses approximately range around 5 to 8K
Groceries, food, quick commerce & utility are my typical expense categories.

Currently I hold the following CC (all LTF):
OneCard (Indian Bank) : 20K Limit (Metal Visa and Virtual Rupay)
Amazon ICICI : 80K (Visa)
ICICI Coral : 80K (Rupay) Shared limit I guess
CSB Edge : 20K (Rupay) via Jupiter (salary account)

My current flow is to put utility on the Amazon ICICI card (random coupons for ₹10 - ₹50 off etc).
Edge card (2% cashback on dining enabled) for food delivery, restaurants/bakeries and quick commerce apps.
Coral/Edge rupay cards via Kiwi for merchant purchases (supermarkets, medical stores, books).
OneCard with 0 forex offer for random one off online purchases.

Apay cashback, jupiter jewel and kiwi coins are my main ""rewards"" off of CC. I do not care for lounge access and do not travel much (Two 50km train rides in UR per week at most).

my strategy where I don’t over optimise.

- Yes bank kiwi credit card 2% on upi

- Amex travel - 10k amazon voucher each month and use that on groceries and utility. Also, pay nps and tax payments

- amex gold for fuel on hp pumps and vouchers of brands when i do offline or online shopping, give 5X mr points

- sbi cashback, wherever i cant use vouchers by amex gyftr or axis gyftr

- axis atlas for all offline transactions and pos machine swipes. Also, buy vouchers from axis gyftr as i get good discount on vouchers first and then also get 7.2% on discounted price so roughly 9-10% crazy deal. Book all indigo flights using atlas and end up with 18% return in form of accor. I find accor has decent properties and are little economical as compared to marriott redemption for amex

- recently added hsbc live+ for blinkit, zepto, swiggy, zomato, eatsure, swish, reliance mart and all grocerries stores. Paying at any cafe also gives 10% but it is capped at 1000. So i can spend only 10k each month to get 1k back. After 10k i shift back to atlas or amex

- have been buying amazon vouchers and using them everywhere possible. Also, you can buy amazon vouchers on amazon using sbi cashback and you ll get 5% cashback

Have few more ltf cards only for bank offers which i use rarely. Let me know if i can add something or can switch to optimise more. 

Thanks :)","['From where you are buying vouchers?', 'Amex gyftr and axis gyftr and sometimes directly from amazon']",cred
Need suggestions on what to add / remove,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jjok9m/need_suggestions_on_what_to_add_remove/,2025-03-25,"I started around 2 years back when icici platinum was the only card I could get. Fast forward to now, I've 8 credit cards.

ICICI platinum (LTF Ofcourse)is still there as it's my first ever cc

ICICI HPCL (500+)  is for petrol. I am able to extract more value in a year than it's annual fees. Also for first year fee waived off after 1.5L spend.

I got Diners Club Privilege (LTF) because it was available as LTF and I didn't have any HDFC card, and also has BOGO upto 250 rs twice a month on weekends (got rejected for millennia/regalia earlier)

IDFC First Wealth (LTF) gives upto 250 Rs off (BOGO) on Movies. Earlier when my spends were from this card, it gave 2 lounge access / 2 spa access per quarter which is USP of this card IMO.

I had got Altura+ (LTF) as my 2nd credit card because again it was LTF and kept it just for AU Bank offers (later regretted not getting AU Ixigo)

Axis MyZone (LTF) was yet another card I got just for Axis Bank offers. Earlier also had no spend criteria lounge access. Literally zero benefit now (Apart from some Swiggy discounts)

I got the Adani ICICI (FYF) from Adani lounge at Mumbai airport because it was being offered FYF. Additionally it has some decent benefits IMO. It offers discounts on Railway bookings, Gas/Electricity payment etc. Also has 2 lounge access per quarter (business class lounge at Adani lounges) Might continue/close this card from next year.

Finally I added a premium credit card to my portfolio as I was scrolling through Axis Open app and saw that I have Axis Atlas (5k+) pre approved. Got the digital card instantly. Now I try to spend as far as possible from this card. Specially flight bookings. Also had to pay hotel bill around 1L so got this card just in time for that.

Then I have 2 debit cards. HDFC millennia (also offers 1 lounge/qtr on 5k spend, better criteria than millennia CC)

And then I have the GOAT debit card. The SBI Visa Platinum. This is the only card which gives 2 lounge access per quarter without spend criteria, without maintenance charge. And also has access to any lounge I have ever been to (BLR 080 included)

During these two years I tried to get many other cards but got rejected regardless of my CIBIL score and other things. These include Scapia, Millennia, Kiwi, POP Club, IndusInd Legend/Tiger, HSBC Live+ etc.

What card should I try getting next? I'll be applying after 5 months from now 
Also any card to discard?

**I already have 8 credit cards:**

**Amazon pay ICICI**

**HDFC SWIGGY**

**ONE CARD**

**YES BANK KIWI**

**KOTAK IOCL CREDIT CARD (temporarily blocked, its pretty useless imo)**

**IDFC POWER PLUS**

**AMEX MRCC**

**RBL BOOK MY SHOW CARD** (I was attracted to the free tickets but I dont spend 5k per month on this so it's been sitting there without any transactions)

**Current Cibil: 758**

**Age: 23**

Monthly Income and Employment status: I'm a medical **student** and self employed, variable income depending on how i work ranging between nothing to 1L

**(the initial goal was to build a strong credit history for my future as I might need loans for my education and my parents don't have a good credit history because of old loans which are now cleared but their CIBIL has been impacted)**

**Monthly Expenses & Spending Patterns:** other than basic necessities, I don't shop a lot, my mom might use my credit card for her business so it gives her extra cashflow.

**Top 5 Monthly spend categories and Top 5 Annual spend categories:**

Groceries

Shopping

Utilities like electricity bills 

**Preferences for Credit Card Features:**

Lounge access

good cashback

good points system for future  benefits

**Reward Preference (Cashback or Reward Points):** anything? both?

**Lounge Access Required:** sure

","['You already have Amazon Pay ICICI and HDFC Swiggy which should be good enough for online cashback and great cashback cards. You still feel you need SBI cashback you could try for that and close HDFC Swiggy if it is not LTF. Or HSBC Live+ for offline shopping (is a paid card). \n\nFor lounge without any spend criteria IndusInd Tiger is good and LTF — 8 domestic + 2 international per year. \n\nYou know the cards you are not using. If they are not LTF close them—no brainer. If they are LTF you could keep them but make sure you manage carefully — the chances of missing a small payment are huge if you have too many cards. As you build your career you will build CIBIL score too. You need just one or two cards to build a score so you can safely close the cards you don’t use. \n\nDon’t worry about good point system for future benefits. Given the devaluations, new card launches, etc. what’s good now may be useless 5 years down the line. Amex points may still hold value though, but your spends may make it a poor choice given their relatively higher fees. \n\nFor example I guess you don’t use Kotak IOCL because fuel isn’t a spend category. If that’s the case and the card is paid, close it. If it’s LTF keep it for the future if you feel like. I myself use my Kotak IOCL for fuel and while it’s not the best fuel card it works fine, had no issue with points being added after purchase at any IOCL pump, unlike my ICICI HPCL Super Saver where points were never added and I had to ask customer service every time. \n\nAnd be a bit careful about your mum using your cards for her business.

"Looking for suggestions for a reliable, hassle-free UPI-enabled credit card in India (2025)",https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jf3smq/looking_for_suggestions_for_a_reliable_hasslefree/,2025-03-19,"I have monthly expenses of around ₹20,000-₹25,000, primarily through UPI payments. About ₹2,000 of this consists of small payments (₹20-₹30 each), while the rest are usually over ₹100, with one major payment of ₹16,000 for my PG rent.

Currently, I use the SBI Cashback card, but I can't use it for my PG rent payments, which is a downside. So, I'm looking for a UPI-enabled credit card that offers a straightforward cashback process (similar to the SBI Cashback, which I find easy to use). Cashback value isn’t my top priority—anything is better than the zero cashback I currently get—but ease of use is key.

I’ve already ruled out Kiwi due to concerns about its acceptability and reliability. Also, I’m not keen on the Tata NeuCard because its cashback points can only be redeemed within the Tata ecosystem, which feels too restrictive for my needs.

Could anyone recommend a good, reliable, and hassle-free UPI-enabled credit card for my situation?

Received Tata Neu Plus Rupay 2 weeks ago. Closing before renewal. Need validation.,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jck3bn/received_tata_neu_plus_rupay_2_weeks_ago_closing/,2025-03-16,"I had a secured IDFC Wow and a Kotak League Rupay. I had got these for Lounge and UPI respectively and it was convenient since I had good family level relationships with both banks. Having used these for 2 years and frequenting this sub I realised I wasn't really earning anything in the name of rewards or cashbacks so I decided to close the secured card (regretting now as it was LTF and Visa Infinite: 1+1 on BMS) and get 2 new cards: SBI Cashback Mastercard and Tata Neu Infinity Rupay.  
I got the SBI one easily with a 90k+ limit but HDFC only gave me a secured Tata Neu plus. Having had both the cards for a couple of weeks I have learned a few things:   
1. Tata Neu app is bs - like the worst shopping or finance app I have ever used. Paytm was a thousand times better at both.  
2. The Neucoin cashback system is too variable and complex. I have yet to understand how can I get the promised 7%.  
3. Even if I do get the 7% back in neucoins, it means I will have to use them instead of the card the next time which I think technically results to an effective return of 3.5% which is less than what SBI offers. (I have also been using my father's Amazon Pay card with prime and at least I can use the cashback in places I won't actually get the 5% CB, so I am using APay wallet when only losing out on the 1% CB transactions.)  
 4. Having a co-branded HDFC card is not a good idea if I'm hoping to get a core card anytime soon. (Based on the discussions on this sub).

Since most my transactions are online, I am pretty content with a straight up 5% from SBI. When I do use UPI it's mostly for chai coffee (lot of txns < INR 100) and it is my understanding that Tata Neu CB doesn't apply to them.

For some reason I could not get the Kiwi card so I am going to keep this card for UPI transactions for a while, but I have decided to close it before the end of the year. Until then I am hoping to find a replacement for a good cashback card for UPI. 

In the near future I am also hoping to get a separate fuel card (fuel spending \~40-45k p.a.) and enter the Amex world. Would value your inputs.",[],kiwi

I'm looking to add a Rupay card for UPI spends and/or close/upgrade my existing set. Here's my existing card collection:

1. HDFC Millenia - Oldest. Limit 1.8L - Primarily used for online orders and payments because of the 5% cashback which I redeem as statement credit
2. SBI Vistara - Primary card - Limit 2.3L. Used for all major expenses to get flight tickets via milestone benefits including offline transactions. Need to take ~6-10 domestic flights a year so I'm able to get at least 2-3 from this in a calendar year 
3. Amazon ICICI - 2.4L limit. Mainly used for Amazon spends.
4. Axis MyZone - Limit - 85k. Had taken for the Swiggy discount and 1+1 on movie tickets. Swiggy discount is negligible now as rarely order above 500. Movie tickets has also shifted to District app (By Zomato) and 1+1 eligible theatres has reduced. Looking to either close or upgrade this card as it's not eligible for major discounts in online sales too
5. Indusind Legend - Limit 2.47L - Had taken the card for the oberoi voucher but got pissed it is not included in LTF, even after confirmation from Indusind spokesperson. Additionally sometimes use it for 1+1 movie tickets or Dining discounts. Same as Axis, looking to either close, upgrade or write a complaint to Ombudsman for mis selling (I have written communication, though over whatsapp)

What do you suggest I do. Current cards I've thought -
- For rupay, going for Yes Bank Kiwi for daily UPI spends (metro city)
- Indusind - Write a strong worded letter. Else, close
- Axis - Close/Upgrade

You can also use the card to book flight tickets and hotels which will give even more pts.\n\nAll in all cards that have better reward rate than millenia in hdfc are travel focussed if you wanna reap maximum benefit but you can redeem the pts for vouchers too.\n\nSo you buy vouchers for your spends from smartbuy and redeem the pts for vouchers.""]",cred

Need suggestions on next card.,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j1vdqt/need_suggestions_on_next_card/,2025-03-02,"Inviting ideas on how can I optimise my credit cards and what cards I should aim for?

Salary income : 275000+
Cards:
ICICI Platinum Visa LTF: primary card , not used except free standing instructions

ICICI Rubyx Master Card + Amex LTF: primary card for offline spends (restaurants, shopping, car service , school fees, gold purchase, medical etc) and occasionally for fuel. Also I pay health insurance, car insurance etc from this card annually. When on official travel, I use this for hotel bill payment and get it reimbursed from office. Have used for international expenses once or twice. I also use this for lounge access when needed at airport. Not a big fan though.

ICICI Amazon Pay LTF: Used on Amazon and Bill payments on Amazon like Airtel Internet, electricity bills. Also used for Amazon fresh grocery

All ICICI cards hold a shared limit of 15 L.
Typical monthly spend around 50K . Goes up when there are occasional spends.

HDFC : Indian oil Rupay LTF : used earlier for fuel, up until recently used for UPI 

HDFC Tata Neu infinity Rupay: FYF : got this last week. Have switched UPI spend to this. I’m not much into TATA eco system.  Got this for lounge access and hoping to hit 3L annual spend, if not I may cancel this next year.

All HDFC cards hold shared limit of 180,000. Typical monthly spend have been 4 ~ 8k

SBI Cashback card VISA: used for non Amazon online spends. Mostly DMart online, Zepto , Zomato etc. Got about 12k cashback in last year. Recently started using Park+ fuel vouchers. Typical monthly spend have been 12K. Used for medplus online, OTT monthly subscriptions etc. Limit 150,000

I’ve recently applied for Kiwi card and it’s about to be issued. Expecting this by next week. 

CIBIL score : 800+

My primary banking relationship is with ICICI. For some reason, all card upgrade offers that were showing up earlier are no longer showing up.  But RM is offering Emerald ( regular, not private metal) on 12K /year fee basis. I’m asking for LTF.

HDFC wasn’t offering any upgrades and recently learned that when you hold contended card like Indian oil, no upgrades are offered.  

I’ve not used iShop or smart buy yet. Recently learned from this community that there is some value.

What cards I should target next? I’m thinking AU Ixigo for international travel which I may take up with in this year. Also, anything to ditch?

1 kiwi coin is 0.25₹.


For all transactions below 50₹ i use kiwi to get 0.25-0.75₹.

1st CC Application Rejected. When can I apply next?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j1p9gb/1st_cc_application_rejected_when_can_i_apply_next/,2025-03-02,"My primary aim is to get a RuPay Credit Card, so that I can atleast use it for some UPI Spends and build a Credit Score, that can be used for applying for better CCs in the long-term.

Adding to that, my dad suggested me to look up for some **LTF** Cards, which narrowed down my options, So I applied for the **IndusInd Legend RuPay CC**, the application process was simple, just going with the following steps:

Verify Mobile / PAN / Aadhaar > Verify Personal Email > Verify Work Email > Provide 6 Months of Salary Bank Acct Statements...

So in the final step ie, `Provide 6 Months of Salary Bank Acct Statements...`  I took out a single Bank Statement pdf for the 6 months history, instead of 6 separate monthly bank statements... given that it was exactly 6 months since I started as a salaried employee (received 6 monthly pays), but the application got rejected within 5 mins...

Now, I'm sceptical about a few things, and would like some clarity:

1. What is the ideal amount of cooldown time I need to wait till I make a new and fresh attempt for a CC Application, to avoid another *hard-enquiry* on my non-existent Credit Score.
2. Was I being too ambitious in attempting for an **LTF** Card as my **First** Card (obviously no Credit Score atm) and given that I'm just having 6 months of salary payouts?
3. Definitely, I'm thinking of applying for some other **LTF RuPay CCs** but not the Legend Card again... What other options do I have in this category? I'm not looking towards the Kiwi Card as well, since I don't want to get into that `neo subscription`...

Avoid choosing a card out of FOMO; instead, select a card that aligns with your lifestyle and offers benefits that truly suit your needs. This way, you’ll get the most value from it rather than the other way around.\n\nIt’s important to note that simply requesting a card to be converted to LTF (Lifetime Free) may not be granted easily. Typically, this requires either a strong relationship with the bank or demonstrating significant usage of your Regalia Gold card. Additionally, HDFC markets the Regalia Gold as a sub-premium category card, and they aim to ensure value from the card as well. \n\nA more effective approach would be to show consistent and high usage of the card, ideally reaching or exceeding the threshold for an annual fee waiver(in a short time preferable). Afterward, you could request a conversion to LTF.

I recently cancelled my existing Yes Bank Rio credit card and am looking to apply for Yes Bank Kiwi Credit Card. The eligibility criteria for the Kiwi card state that you shouldn’t be an existing Yes Bank customer at the time of application.

"Appreciation post & detailed review of my cards - SBI CB, IDFC Wow, RBL Shoprite.",https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1isk4kk/appreciation_post_detailed_review_of_my_cards_sbi/,2025-02-18,"Hi guys, I've started my CC journey late Oct 2024. Thanks for letting me know about all the information!!!

So, Here's my journey!

- **Applied (in order):** Kiwi YesB, IDFC Wow, Amazon ICICI, SBI Cashback, AU Ixigo, Airtel Axis, RBL Shoprite, IndusIND Tiger, SBI Platinum Debit, Uni Gold X, Axis Neo.

- **Approved:** IDFC Wow Visa LTF + Rupay Virtual 200/yr FYF (FD max limit), SBI Cashback (20k) - 999/yr, RBL Shoprite LTF (25k), SBI Platinum Debit 300/yr.

### My experience with Credit Score Agencies:

- Closing off overdraft against FD gave me a boost of 64 points immediately (692 -> 756), it was my only credit product I had, running since 3 years since I was a student back then. It was a flexi loan, so no EMI = no default possible, was just interest at 1% above FD.

- Multiple enquiries does not really cost much, in my experience - 1 point drop every 2 enquiries. This has been my experience, maybe it differ for other ppl.

### My experience with my approved CCs:

1. IDFC Wow:

  - **IDFC App:** Really helpful, every details is clearly given, easy dispute for old transactions, **MCC code is clearly given of each and every txn** (I really like this feature - helps for other card spend criterias too).

  - **IDFC Wow Visa:** Good discounts on Flipkart Mobile phones, used for 2-3k off on 20-25k segment twice. This is other than reward points which is 0.67% in addition.

  - **IDFC Wow Rupay:** Zomato for limited period have flat 15% off over 3k+ bill  upto Rs1200, used that multiple times (almost once or twice every month). I got this as FYF and 200/yr after, mostly only for UPI or zomato, might not close as the benefit of viewing MCC codes is actually a plus for me. Found a lot of juice shops have groccery MCC which I can utilize with my other card.

  - Cons: Rs99+gst redemption fees (468 points go in vain), so haven't yet redeem anything till now, good thing points never expire.

2. SBI Cashback:

  - No Nonsense card, straight 5% off (I see effective ~4.81% because of rounding off maybe). Cashback visible within 2-4 days as soon as txn is settled.

  - Sadly got only 20k limit. For big ticket purchases I generally mix with rest of amount to Amazon Shopping Voucher from IDFC Poshvine (3% off).

  - **SBI Card App:** is little shit. My card is currently in my hometown, can't swipe and get 1% sadly for now, Tap n Pay doesn't work in SBI Card App (says server down). Although Scan n Pay worked in one of the restaurant (BharatQR) making me eligible for 5% back on offline.

3. RBL Shoprite:

  - Just issued, already knew MCC of frequent juice shops & dmart using my previous txn on IDFC Wow. 5% off on groccery offline / upi.

  - Con: Previous txn rewards not visible, don't know when it is processed.

  - Con: Same problem with IDFC Wow, Rs99+gst for redemption, and points expire in 2 years. But hey, its better than 1% I'd be getting using SBI CB in offline setting.

### My current strategy

1. Online / BharatQR (rare) / McDonalds online order on dinein: SBI CB (5%).
2. Offline Grocery / Juice Shops: RBL Shoprite via UPI (5%).
3. Limit exhausted: IDFC Wow - via poshvine GV or directly (0.67% swipe|upi>2k or 0.16% on upi<2k).
4. Lounge - SBI Platinum DC (2/quater).

5. Dipping
  - IDFC Poshvine -> AmazonPay Voucher (1%) -> Uber (5%)
    - Nowadays I use namma yatri in blr or I already get 17% off on Uber iykyk.
  - IDFC Poshvine -> Amazon Shopping Voucher (3%) partial pay possible, rest via other CC
  - Any Rupay -> Zomato Dining (15%)

6. Bill Pay
  - IndMoney with UPI, I was getting 0.3% consistently back.
  - Might switch to Mobikwik this month, getting Rs350 cb as first time user for first payment and fullpay consecutively, later 1% is back as supercash (which can be used as 5% of utility payments / mobile recharges - Axis Neo alternative lol). Also, Mobikwik allows SBI DC as payment method, which gives 0.25% back similar to the INDMoney anyway.

### MCC Codes

Here's the list of MCC Codes I found using my IDFC card (will keep updating):

Best Cards for Each Category,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ise3mb/best_cards_for_each_category/,2025-02-18,"Hi sub, I hold multiple cards(a bit too many TBH) and I've noticed that this community often inquires about the best credit cards for various categories like travel, shopping, jewelry, insurance, shopping, movies, taxis, and more. So, here's my effort to compile the top credit cards for each category.

**Food & Groceries**

* Food: HSBC Live+ for 10% cashback for offline dining payment. Infinia for 16.25% for Swiggy/Zomato vouchers. Special mention: Indusind Eazydiner Platinum/Signature card for 20%/25% up to 500/1000 off if you have booked an appointment via Eazydiner. There are other cards which will give up to 40% across Zomato, Swiggy, Easydiner etc, but minimum amount is more than 2500.
* Groceries: HSBC Live+ for 10% cashback for offline & online groceries payment. 10% is even applicable on Dmart, Lulu, SPAR etc. Infinia for 16.25% using vouchers.

Tip: Make sure to apply for HSBC Live+ via CashKaro. You get 2200 cashback within 3 months which is basically 2 years free. I have personally done this, so its verified. You can do the same for other credit cards like SBI CB etc. Alternatives for CashKaro are Gromo, ZET partner etc for many other credit cards to get cashback for applying for a credit card.

**Travel**

* Book a Cab: ICICI Emerald Private/Infinia for 18%/15% + 5% using Apay Vouchers(for Uber).
* Rent a Cab: Infinia for 16.25% if you book ZoomCar via gyft

* Book Train Ticket: Infinia - 10% using Smartbuy.
* Book Flight Ticket: Infinia - 16.5% using Smartbuy. Special mention: Amex Platinum Charge - 20% in Air India if you use points smartly.
* Book Hotels: Infinia - Infinia - 33% using Samrtbuy. ICICI Emerald Private - 36% using iShop.

**Bill Payments**

* Utility Bill Payments: ICICI Emerald Private/Infinia for 18%/13% for paying via Apay Vouchers wherever necessary. Special Mention: Airtel Axis Bank for 25% cashback. But the monthly limit is pretty low.
* QR Payment: Yes Bank Kiwi for 2-5% based on milestone.
* Tax Payment: HDFC Biz Metal for 15%

**Generic Payments**

* Any Online Transaction: SBI cashback for 5%
* Any Offline Transaction: Axis Atlas for 4-10%
* Any International Online Transaction: Yes Bank Marquee for 3.3% (Yes Bank Reserve 3X might provide 3.375%, but need someone to confirm)
* Any International Offline Transaction: Yes Bank Reserve 3X  for 3.375%

**Shopping**

Shopping via Vouchers: Infinia for 16.5% + additional voucher discount. Special mention: Check magic pin for great offers like Puma etc.

**Milestone Related Payments**

Milestone Payments: Amex Trifecta(Platinum Travel, Gold Charge & MRCC) for 10%. You can use these cards for transactions that are mostly excluded like Education fees, Insurance fees, Jewellery, NPS etc.

**Good LTF Credit Cards**

* Tata Neu Infinity for 5% on all Tata products including Tanishq.
* ICICI Sapphiro for BOGO on Movies up to 500. Special Mention: IDFC Wealth/Axis My Zone for BOGO.
* HDFC Swiggy Credit Card for 10% off on Swiggy and 5% on most online categories

Infinity give 1.5% cashback on upi if you use tata neu app.


If your transaction in kiwi is Rs.75, you will only get kiwi point for Rs.50.

For maximum benefits, Neon membership can be purchased for Kiwi. Neon membership costs 999+GST. Tata Neu infinity card charges 1499+gst joining and annual fee
Even with the Kiwi Neon membership, the maximum cashback one can get is 5% kiwi points for spends above 1.5L and 1 kiwi point is equivalent to Rs. 0.25 which effectively makes it Rs.1875 , which is 1.25% returns in rupees terms. 
On the other hand, Tata Neu offers 1.5% Tataneu coins on upi spends and 1 Neu coin is 1rupee. So, for a spend of 1.5L, this is 2250 Neucoins and is equivalent to 2250 rupees,  which is still 1.5% returns in rupees terms.

Kiwi UPI Credit Card - Horrible KYC experience & Zero Customer Support!,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ilivqk/kiwi_upi_credit_card_horrible_kyc_experience_zero/,2025-02-09,"

Hey everyone,

I recently applied for the Kiwi UPI Credit Card and was in the middle of my video eKYC when I was asked to confirm my non-mailing address. Shockingly, it only showed my city, India, instead of my full address.

I immediately pointed this out and told them that my non-mailing address is the same as my mailing address, but they refused to correct it, saying they can’t do anything about it and that I need to cancel my application and reapply from scratch.

The worst part? There’s no way to edit the address, no option to fill it correctly, and absolutely no way to contact customer support—no chat, no helpline, nothing. It’s as if once you're stuck, you're on your own.

With this experience, I am seriously reconsidering my decision to go for Kiwi. If their support is this bad during onboarding, I can’t imagine what would happen if there’s an issue with transactions, billing, or fraud in the future. Even if this somehow gets resolved, I’ve lost confidence in their ability to handle customer concerns.

Has anyone else faced this? Any idea how to escalate this?

🚨 Kiwi Free RuPay Credit Card – Fraud & Malpractices Exposed! 🚨,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ilbtqt/kiwi_free_rupay_credit_card_fraud_malpractices/,2025-02-09,"I have been **struggling for 3 months** to get a **valid reason** for my Kiwi YES Bank Credit Card rejection, despite having a **₹1L+ salary** & **770+ CIBIL score**! **No transparency, no accountability** from both **Kiwi** and **Yes Bank.**

https://preview.redd.it/fszube21b3ie1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=f63a6fa505c0d8441eb5f9131f0f2c9f22df3edd

# ❌ Timeline of the Fraud

📌 **Applied in November** – Kiwi rejected the card citing *""internal policy""* but **did not provide any valid reason.**  
📌 **2 months struggling with Kiwi** – Their only response? *""Keep using our app for UPI transactions.""* Instead of resolving my complaint, they’re **shamelessly advertising their UPI service!**  
📌 **40 days chasing Yes Bank** – Their **credit card support team could not even find my application details** when I called. But somehow, their **grievance team is replying to my emails** with vague responses like *""internal policies.""* If Yes Bank has no record, then how is Kiwi even partnered with them? This **seems like a scam!**

# ⚠️ RBI Guidelines Violated

📌 **As per RBI Circular DBOD.No.Leg.BC.65/09.07.005/2006-07 dated March 6, 2007, Point 5 clearly states:**

*""In case of all categories of loans irrespective of any threshold limits, including credit card applications, banks / FIs should convey in writing the main reason / reasons which, in the opinion of the bank / FI have led to rejection of the loan applications.""*

📌 **Neither Kiwi nor Yes Bank** is following these RBI-mandated guidelines! They **keep avoiding the issue** with vague responses.  
📌 If **Yes Bank’s Nodal Officer** also fails to provide a proper explanation, I will **file a formal complaint with RBI.**

# 🔥 User Complaints & Hidden Comments

📌 **Many users** have reported **similar issues** on Kiwi’s **Instagram comments**, but Kiwi is **hiding them to cover up their mistakes**!  
📌 Their customer support is **non-existent** – no responses, no resolution.

# 🚨 Time for an Investigation!

Kiwi & Yes Bank’s **malpractices must be reviewed by RBI & NPCI!** Their **free RuPay credit card** is misleading, with **no real support** for customers.

1. SBI Prime (LTF/VISA) - Corporate TieUP
2. Amazon pay ICICI (LTF/VISA)
3. Flipkart Axis (LTF/VISA)

Needed one **RuPay for UPI** and got TataNue Plus (LTF) last December. Thought one HDFC in arsenal would be good. For UPI, I use BHIM. **Now the concerns are:**

1. Its co-branded, so may not be eligible for instant discount offers of HDFC card (please confirm).

2. Using UPI for fuel to avoid surcharge (GST) and time to swipe card. Am I doing it right?

3. As I use BHIM, last month got only 23 Nuecoin for 19k UPI spend. Using TataNue app will fetch more coin I guess. But this month, in some spends through TataNue app, coins are not consistent/straight forward, unlike FK/aPay cards.

4. Not in Tata ecosystem. So Nuecoins are not that beneficial like AmazonPay balance for me.

**Please give insight for my above queries. Will be highly grateful brothers and sirs.** 

Also, have some thought on other cards:

a. Airtel Axis - Do the offer to select RuPay? b. Indusind - They do call me regularly. LTF. But which one to choose? c. Kiwi - Some suggestions in this forum.

**In comparison to TataNue Plus, which of the above give better cashback for normal UPI transaction from BHIM, not their own app?**  ","['Kiwi (but i guess you must use kiwi app)', '1) HDFC hardly offers instant discount anywhere.

It has to be swipe transaction only for fuel surcharge waiver. Tata neu offers a 1% fuel surcharge waiver\n\n3) When you do UPI from tata neu app, you get 0.5% neu coins in the app and 0.5% neu coins will come in the credit card statement. (For plus variant)\n\n4) For rupay, tata Neu infinity is the best card. Plus is ok but not that great. Kiwi is the best for your use case. AU spont has a 1% reward rate on UPI. I don’t know any others that are above 1%.\n\nDefinitely upgrade to Neu infinity if you can. It was being offered LTF sometime back not sure if its still LTF. I have it as a paid card.

I have the Axis Ace card, which is good for offline spending, I get around 1.5%, but I can't use it for 50 rs. stuff at local thela wala, but who has a QR.

3.Fuel maximum means if u cross this limit 1% transaction charges will be applicable. Reward points vary for each card.

Current Cards review and recommendation,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ibverr/current_cards_review_and_recommendation/,2025-01-28,"Hi all. I am new to this sub. I have the below credit cards.

1. Amazon Pay LTF
2. Flipkart Axis LTF
3. Idfc select LTF
4. SBI simplisave FYF (500 Annual Fee)
5. Axis Indian Oil LTF
6. IndusInd Legend LTF (never used this. Bought this for BOGO movie tickets. But never worked)

My main spends are some random shopping in flipkart or Amazon. Random Food delivery through swiggy or zomatto. 1.5k EB and gas bills per month. 5K per quarter in Dmart. Bus bookings every month in redbus. And offline spends in UPi and Card

Applied for below
1. Kiwi yes bank card LTF
2. Hdfc swiggy LTF

Planning to apply 
1. Tata Nue infinity. FYF. (This is mainly for insurance spends as I Pay around 85k every year. But reluctant as I am not a user of tata products and not sure about usage of neu points)
2. Airtel axis (for utility payments which i am currently using apay with 2% cashback)
3. HSBC live + for Dmart and offline spending as it's give 1.5% for offline

If you take MRCC, you can load up on apay vouchers like i mentioned and pay for insurance.  If not, then yes, Infinity makes sense. But the FYF component is not good considering you might only use it for insurance spends.\n\n4. You can basically buy apay vouchers and stock them in your amazon pay balance for eventualy paying off insurance ( Gets you base and milestone rewards this way) or use it via park + for petrol making sure you transact for 1500 or 2000 each time . As long as you hit 1.5L annual spends on MRCC, you hit the fee waiver AND you can clock around 5% returns if you redeem the MR for apay vouchers. If you redeem for Tanisq or Taj or Airmiles or Marriot, return rate goes up. Amex is all about Milestones, hit them and you are good. Doesnt matter offline or Online. Milestone + 1.5L or Milestone + 2.4L total spends, gets you 5% and 4% return rate.\n\n5. Agreed. Again, if not taking MRCC, go this route.\n\n6. Gotcha. You can get one if you need it. ITs a bonus of that card.\n\n  \nId say no issue in taking too many cards other than it becoming a headache to handle and optimize thats all. Thats the reason i am suggesting MRCC cause it sort of solves the issue of 3 cards in one. Earlier SBI CB could do the same role as mrcc but they patched it, only beneficial way to buy apay voucher is via park+ or Magic Pin ( if the MCC matches) and that too has a chance of getting patched. meanwhile, with MRCC , you can just directly buy apay voucher from amazon site itself and it will count for base and milestone reward.\n\n  \nIf you are sure you can handle so many cards, go ahead bro.

Follow basic tips to improve your score, as this will demonstrate your creditworthiness to banks.\n\nAfter a few months, you can reach out to your bank to request the reactivation of your old card. Make sure to settle all outstanding dues with them and assure them that you won’t repeat past mistakes. This can help rebuild trust.

I hope everyone is doing well. I need your insights and experiences to decide on credit cards, below is my usage/requirement.

1. Grocery - Monthly 5K
2. Fuel - Monthly 2-3K
3. Education - Yearly 3L
4. Insurance - yearly 50K

Spend pattern

**1. Online Purchase -**  
I have an SBI Cashback and HDFC Swiggy that covers most of my online expenses.

**2. Offline Purchase**—My major offline spending is on Fuel, Groceries, Education Fees, etc.  
Here, I use an SBI BPCL Card and IDFC Power + credit card

3. **UPI Spends**—I have the Kiwi App, which is my primary app for UPI spending, so I am happy with this.

Both IDFC Power+ and SBI BPCL are **paid cards,** but the **Fee** is not a concern as the spend is more than 2L, so I will get a **waiver**.

**IDFC Power+**:  
**Fuel**—It's good for Fuel only and works on all HPCL pumps.  
**Grocery** & Utility - 30X Rewards, Max 400 Rewards = ₹100 /month  
**Education** \- 3X Reward points if UPI is used, no capping.

**SBI BPCL**:  
**Fuel** \- I am planning to upgrade this card to **BPCL Octane**. I will get a reward of 6.25% on Fuel, but the only challenge is the Reward will be applicable **only to select BPCL pumps** and does not work on all BPCL pumps. They have their own list that gets updated monthly

**Grocery & Utility:** It offers 2.5% off groceries and a maximum of 7,500 Reward Points per month.  
**Education**: You will receive 1 Reward point for every 100 Rs. spent on other retail purchases (Except Mobile wallet uploads and non-BPCL fuel spends).

**Other Cards \[LTF\]**  
HDFC Regalia Gold  
BOB Eterna  
IDFC Wealth  
ICICI Sapphiro  
HDFC Swiggy  
IndusInd Pinnacle  
AU LIT  
Kiwi -Yes bank  
ICICI Amazon Pay

**Goals**

Online - one card for online -SBI Cashback is something I am considering

UPI - Kiwi Yes bank

But for offline

* Now, I need one card that I can consider for Fuel, Grocery, clothes, Education Fees, and other offline spending. Which one to use
* For Travel - I have Regalia Gold, and I am working towards upgrading it to Infinia in the Future.
* I thought of getting HSBC Live+ but it's good only for Grocery.

Considering Rejecting the HDFC Tata Neu Plus Rupay Credit Card – Seeking Advice,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i83uez/considering_rejecting_the_hdfc_tata_neu_plus/,2025-01-23," 

I currently have 3 credit cards, all from ICICI:

1. ICICI Platinum Visa
2. ICICI Coral Rupay
3. ICICI Amazon Pay Visa

A few weeks ago, after reading some positive responses here, (without giving much thought) I applied for 2 credit cards.

1. HDFC Tata Neu Plus Rupay Credit Card
2. Yes Bank Kiwi Rupay Card

The Kiwi card was approved, but the Tata Neu card was initially rejected.

Meanwhile I started using Kiwi app (using my saving account to make payments instead of Kiwi Credit card since it is more rewarding, not sure how, activated Neom BTW) for almost all of my online transactions except APay for Amazon.

However, out of nowhere, I received an email from HDFC yesterday saying that my Tata Neu Plus Rupay card application was accepted and I’ll receive the card in 3 days.

Now, after looking into it more, I’m unsure if I really need the Tata Neu card. I don’t shop much with Tata or its associated brands (I checked the Neu app), and I’m not sure I can justify the annual fee of Rs 499 + GST, let alone make a profit from it.

So, I’m looking for suggestions from you all: Should I not activate? Or should I activate it and try to ask for a waiver of the annual fee later on?

Also, I’m considering upgrading my ICICI Coral Rupay card to the ICICI HPCL Superseva Visa card to earn rewards on my petrol bills.

Any thoughts on that?

Last Infinity stone for my Cashback CC gauntlet,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i7donj/last_infinity_stone_for_my_cashback_cc_gauntlet/,2025-01-22,"Man, I'm here to share my credit card journey over the past six months. I waited a long time to post this with how weirdly HSBC ghosts you after the vKYC lol.

I joined this sub in June/July of last year with a very naive question, asking whether my floater card spends would count towards the fee waiver spend for my main card. That single question led me down a whole new path of strategic spending habits, which has made managing my finances so much easier on a moderate salary of 46k per month. I sincerely thank all the card gurus here for opening my eyes to how rewarding a balanced card portfolio can be! 

For all the stupid posts and questions in between, this is still my favorite credit card sub.

Coming to my cards. Currently, I hold 6 cards: HDFC Swiggy, Millennia, Amazon Pay ICICI, Kiwi Klick, Airtel Axis, and, finally, the card I wanted the most my HSBC Live+ (I received it randomly on my birthday, truly felt like a gift)

I recently shared my credit card timeline with someone, so I'll just copy-paste it here with a few edits:

1. Swiggy (LTF): Until the middle of last year, I only had a Moneyback+ card. I saw an LTF offer for the Swiggy card on the app, so I applied and got it. Luckily, right after I received it, the settlement to the credit card statement for cashback was announced. I used it extensively until September, until I was offered a Millennia upgrade on my Moneyback+ FYF.

2. Millennia (FYF): I used the Millennia card everywhere except Swiggy until I received the Kiwi card in November. The renewal fee will be waived as spending 1 lakh in a year isn’t too difficult. A very cool anecdote btw: I used my moneyback+ to book 20k+ Coldplay tickets on BMS, luckily my cc got upgraded to Millennia before the billing cycle and they gave me 1000 cashback for it ✨ timing was on my side.

3. Kiwi (LTF): I was on the waitlist, and they eventually offered the card to me through the app. I got it right away, and I mainly use it for UPI payments.

4. Airtel Axis (Paid): I received a notification on the Airtel app saying I was eligible. I applied and got it. Initially, I didn’t plan on activating it since it had an annual fee, but then I saw it had the highest limit of any card I’ve received, so I decided to activate it. With the welcome voucher, it became effectively FYF. I don’t plan on spending the minimum amount required for the renewal fee waiver, but this card easily gives me 500+ cashback per month, which will cover the fee.

5. Amazon Pay CC (LTF): I was offered this card just a week ago via the Amazon app. I took it because it’s free. I don’t have much use for it, but I’ll use it if I make any large transactions (over 20k) on Amazon. Otherwise, Millennia is enough.

6. HSBC Live+ (Paid): This is the only card I’ve ever truly sought out, and it's perfect for my spending habits. I applied for it through the CashKaro app, which will give me 2200 cashback. Then, the card will give me a 1000 voucher if I spend 20k in a month. Essentially, my joining and renewal fees will be covered for almost two years. Also, this card is so clean and beautiful, even the name is on the back.

Regarding cashback, many people rave about the SBI Cashback card, but at this point, it holds no value for me. I already have similar or even better deals with my other cards. Also, getting SBI Cashback card directly means an absolutely shit credit limit, which severely brings down the cashback potential each month.

I'm going to take a break from applying for any more cards for a long time and just enjoy the benefits of the ones I have.","[""Congratulations!

 Is D-Mart Better for Groceries Compared to Big Basket with Tata Neu Cashback? Let's Discuss!,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i6jvlv/is_dmart_better_for_groceries_compared_to_big/,2025-01-21,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been comparing grocery options lately and wanted to get your take on something. I live just 1 km away from a D-Mart, which is super convenient, and I’ve noticed their prices are quite reasonable. However, I also use Big Basket occasionally, especially because you can get 5-10% cashback through Tata Neu.

Here’s what I’m weighing:

* **D-Mart:** If you pay via UPI, you get 2% cashback using KiWi Yes Bank. Even without the extra cashback from Tata Neu, D-Mart's prices seem *much* cheaper overall compared to Big Basket.
* **Big Basket with Tata Neu:** The cashback (5-10%) is attractive, but even with that, I feel like D-Mart might still come out ahead because their base prices are lower.

For those who’ve used both:

1. Do you think the Tata Neu cashback makes Big Basket worth it, or is D-Mart still the better choice overall?
2. How do you feel about the quality and variety of products between the two?
3. Any other tips or strategies to save on groceries?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences! 😊","['You go to dmart, you do some physical activity, you have some fun.\n  \n2-3% of reward benefits are not worth the health benefits.

I wont go into much past but will tell u recent last 1 year exp of offline mart vs online apps price difference.\n\nNote: My comparison is for Bengaluru location.\n\nIn earlier days Flipkart Grocery used to sell cheapest items, it was my first preference to use with Axis Flipkart card. Issue was for delivery I needed to wait 2-3 days.\n\nThen Bigbasket started selling cheaper items, I chose this because it used to give 5% coins using Tata Neu app.\n\nThen Zepto SuperSaver started giving cheapest items, I used this for a while, issue was its minimum order was 600 that time else need to use normal Zepto where pricing is way higher.\n\nUsed Blinkit Instamart sometimes when some card offer free cash or special coupon they give, usually their price is higher but on adding these discounts it becomes cheaper.\n\nOnly sometimes I saw Amazon fresh selling cheapest items,\n\nOne thing common with all these online items was quality of veggies, it was never consistent, its hit or miss, sometimes good quality comes, sometimes best and sometimes pretty bad. But good thing was u can keep the item and get the refund but that was irritating, u cant always be happy by getting the refund sometimes u do need the item. And many times i need to console with avg quality product like in 1 kg potato 1-2 spoiled piece can come and then just for 1 piece it's not very convenient to return full pack. Moreover availability is an issue in online, most of the times it happens like I want Nandini Cow milk and English Oven Paw bread, then in 1 app milk wont be available and in other app bread wont be available, it forces me to buy whatever is available there. and in no single platform you'll find all cheapest items, So I usually end up buying different products from different apps, now they all will be having certain minimum order value to get better discount, that pushes me to buy more products in cart which I might not be even needing it now may be I need after few weeks, just to get more cart value I needed to add those items, so even if I actually need to buy 600 worth items , I somehow end up buying 1000 or more, see its grocery item , it wont get wasted I know still, I feel guilty. Plus the time which gets wasted in doing comparisons and when ur family  sees WTF he is using mobile all the time, that's really problematic. \n\nNow coming to Star Bazaar, u add all card discounts and coupons with online pricing, that's the price of Star Bazaar, almost 80-85% of the items u can find cheaper than online, rest will be comparable with online. And I'm talking about branded packaged items, loose items and own star branded packets r further cheaper. Add HSBC LIV+ discount for 10% that's unbeatable deal. Packet size is not an issue anymore, I can easily get what size product I want, availability of the product is good. Although it requires travelling but it saves my time compared to online. Even if u leave the pricing the quality of veggies are great, it's super fresh, best thing is u can choose and pick it. I can take any quantity u want not necessarily 0.5kg or 1kg. Veggies are easily 30-60% cheaper than online and even cheaper than local mandi in some cases, add 10% off here also for HSBC. One thing offline supermarket provide is it's shopping exp which no online platform can provide, it's fun and addictive.

Got rejected for Amex MRCC. Should I apply for Gold Charge? Or wait for 90 days and reapply?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i5k99d/got_rejected_for_amex_mrcc_should_i_apply_for/,2025-01-20,"Hi everyone!

So my application for the MRCC card was just rejected.

When I spoke to the customer care, they said I filled in the details in the wrong format even though the details matched with my Aadhar.

Anyway, now I'm stuck having to wait 90 days before I can re-apply.

However, I pay 20k in rent every month and it's my only major expense that I haven't been able to cover for rewards/cashback.

I already own the following cards:

1. Moneyback Plus: First CC, active mostly for bank offers.
2. HDFC Swiggy: Dineout, Food, Groceries.
3. Airtel Axis: Recharge, Utilities.
4. SBI Cashback: Everything else not covered by the two above like Fuel, etc. 

I don't have a UPI card. Got rejected for Kiwi and I make only 70k so can't apply for Tata Neu Infinity.I don't spend a lot through UPI, so wasn't worried about it.

Rent on the other hand is a major chunk of my expenses. But now that MRCC was rejected, idk what would be the best approach here for the next 3 months.

Should I wait for 3 months and apply for the MRCC first? Or should I try my luck with Gold Charge/Smart Earn to get at least some points during these months?

Society maintenance payment query,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i3c149/society_maintenance_payment_query/,2025-01-17,"
Hi all,

I currently pay the society's maintenance fee using a QR code linked to the society’s bank account through UPI. However, I recently received a Yes Bank Kiwi RuPay credit card and now have the option to pay using this card.

My concern is that the society management imposes a penalty if the full maintenance amount isn’t received—even if it’s short by a small amount. I want to confirm whether this issue could arise if Yes Bank deducts a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) from the payment.

For example, if the MDR is 2.5%, only 97.5% of the amount would be credited to the society’s account. In that case, would I be liable for the penalty due to the shortfall?

Additionally, is there any way to avoid this issue while using the Kiwi credit card? I’d prefer not to use third-party rent or maintenance payment apps or websites.

I 10/10 recommend Flash.co email,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i2qrn9/i_1010_recommend_flashco_email/,2025-01-16,"This is not a referral or sponsored post. Just sharing my experience

I've been using Flash.co email for nearly 6 months and had pretty good experience and also received very decent rewards from them. 

So far, I've received 2 Swiggy INR150 vouchers, 2 Swiggy INR100 Vouchers, 2 Swiggy INR50 Vouchers, 1 Amazon INR200 Voucher, and earlier it was also possible to redeem flash coins into cash via UPI like Kiwis so I received around INR750 cashback back then. 

It's pretty simple. You just link you shopping apps with their email and earn flash coins which you can redeem for gift vouchers from their catalogue. They also have some random coupons for 100-200 coins which are useless and a waste of coins so don't redeem for that. 

On top of that, they provide really detailed insights on your spends analysis where you can check your spends category wise and expand it into brand wise analysis. I find it really helpful since it's very hard to keep track of Apay spends for me. 

This has actually decluttered my gmail inbox very well and their own spam/promotion filtering is also good in my experience. 




NOTE: I used multiple flash.co emails which has earned me these rewards collectively as I use multiple accounts for apps like Zomato, Swiggy, etc. 

This will not work for apps like Zepto who do not send an email invoice. 

I have no privacy complaints from them but still, I would not recommend linking any financially related service 

The rewards catalogue is user specific and keep on changing almost everyday so don't be worried if you don't see anything worthwhile. Just keep accumulating the points and wait. You will find a good deal eventually. ","['I was about to hit 5k points for Amazon prime voucher and when I checked today, they removed it from redeem page😭😭', ""I use this too.

Applied, got it, I didn't plan to activate it since it was paid but then it was the most limit in a card I have ever received so activated it. With the welcome voucher it became basically FYF. I don't plan on spending the minimum amount for renewal fee waiver, this card gets 500+ cashback per month easily which will compensate for the renewal fee.\n\n5. Amazon Pay CC: I was being offered the card literally a week back on the Amazon app. Took it cuz it's free, I don't have much use for it, will use it only if I have any transaction above 20k on Amazon. Otherwise Millennia is good enough.\n\n6. HSBC Live+: So this is the only card that I have ever really wished for lol. It's quite perfect for my expenses. I applied for it through the cashkaro app, they will give 2200 cashback if my application gets approved and then the card will give 1000 voucher if I spend 20k in a month.

Credit Card Advice Needed,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hx7es5/credit_card_advice_needed/,2025-01-09,"Hey everyone!

I’m 24 and planning to get my first credit card. Honestly, I’m pretty new to this and could use some advice. I have an ICICI account, so I was considering their card, but I’ve heard mixed reviews about ICICI recently. I also applied for the Kiwi card (RuPay) but got rejected due to ""internal bank policies"" — I really wanted that one!

After some research, I’m leaning towards getting two cards:

1️⃣ A RuPay card (still deciding which one)

2️⃣ An Amex Platinum Travel card (I heard it’s great for benefits)


The challenge is, I don’t have a CIBIL score since I’ve never had a credit card before.

Also, I’m buying an iPhone soon, and there’s a ₹3,000 discount on ICICI, Kotak, and SBI cards. So now I’m wondering if I should pick one of those for the discount.

Any recommendations on the best combo of cards I should go for to maximize discounts and benefits? TIA! 😊","[""Since you don't have a credit card and most probably no credit score, id say do one of the two things below. \n\n1. Check your icici acc for any pre approved credit cards, preferably LTF. If it's available, take it . This way you get an unsecured card , a start to your credit history and credit score, and also discount for your iPhone purchase. \n\n\n2. Get a FD backed secured card, something from either idfc ( idfc wow )or hdfc ( hdfc tata neu fd card ) or super money etc. Use this for 3-6 months to get a good credit score and then take what card makes sense fr you. \n\nDon't look at amex right now without a credit score. Extremely tough to take. Also amex especially PT makes sense if you have 4L spends annually and you can utilise the rewards for travel . Else it's not good. I have an amex trifecta, once you get your first card , dm me and i can guide based on your spends and stuff."", 'Also, have anyone get their Kiwi card accepted after rejection ?', ""Hey if you want an AMEX card, then DM me.

So I have around 8 FDs linked to my One Card (SBM variant) and I wanted to close just 1 FD. So the call center is saying that we can't actually close 1 FD but all FDs has to be closed, along with the card. 

It sounds weird as the additional FDs were created as top-ups to my credit limit and now when OneCard doesn't make much sense, I wanted to reduce my credit limit and withdraw my FD. 

  
Can the group please advise if I should continue with OneCard or just rid of them and withdraw all my FDs.

Kiwi YesBank Credit Card Review - Best Card I've Used!,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hwk0qn/kiwi_yesbank_credit_card_review_best_card_ive_used/,2025-01-08,"https://preview.redd.it/7g7wdeurrrbe1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7a38b7e5528c5e26a00cb4def8b172abf856f3

I’ve been using the Kiwi YesBank credit card for a while now, and it’s honestly the best card I’ve tried recently. The cashback is super quick - it’s credited directly to my bank account instantly, no waiting around.

Just to give you a breakdown: I’ve got ₹4348 in cashback so far. ₹2000 (₹1000 x 2) was from referrals (which is pretty sweet), and the rest came from payments I made. The cashback process is way faster than any other card I’ve used before.

The 2% cashback is insane. I’ve used the Axis Ace Card, which also gives 2%, but that one only credits the cashback to your statement. This one gives it directly to your bank account. Honestly, that’s a huge difference.

Also, I hit the ₹50K milestone and got cashback for that, and now I’m waiting for the ₹1L and ₹1.5L milestones. Can’t wait to see what happens next!

Overall, if you're looking for a solid card with quick cashback and decent rewards, definitely check this one out.","['I have this card too and while it\'s decent, let\'s be real about the ""2% cashback"" marketing. I get ₹3 (12 kiwis) consistently for UPI transfers which is nice, but the main cashback system isn\'t as great as advertised. Here\'s why: you only get 1 kiwi per ₹50 spent, and it only counts in ₹50 increments. So spending ₹249 gets you the same 4 kiwis as spending ₹200 - that\'s not really 2% anymore (drops to 1.61% in this case). For true 2% cashback, you should get 5 kiwis (rounded up from 4.98) on ₹249 spend.\n\nAlso worth noting all these perks are tied to the Neon subscription.

I got the Kiwi Credit Card yesterday. The app looks decent, and the cashback rate seems good at 2% for Kiwi Neon users. Earlier, my primary UPI card was BOB Snapdeal, which offered 1% cashback directly on the statement.

It\'s a personal opinion but I do not believe Tata Co-branded cards are that useful and they are Over Hyped because the cashback comes in the form of Neu Coins in the Tata Neu App - and can only be redeemed for Tata Brands. Plus the app is hella buggy - according to users feedback. Along with that, IMO, it\'s not a good one for general-purpose usage. \n\nSwiggy HDFC CC is way better in that regard - since it\'s 5% general CB works based on MCC and not partner brands, Cashback gets adjusted in next statement and also Swiggy has 10% CB on everything from the app.\n\nAnd if you can\'t get Swiggy HDFC CC, I would personally rather go for Milennia.\n\nNow if you already applied, well you have a CIBIL hit already.

2. Tata Neu Infinity LTF - Applied and received for both me and my wife, may help with 4 international airport lounge.  
  
3. KIWI Yes Bank Rupay LTF - Applied and received for both me and my wife, our annual UPI expenses easily cross like 5L so amazing to get 5% cashback with free first year subscription, may take paid one as we easily manage to recover the fee.  
  
4.

Hope you're doing well. Posting here to seek suggestion/experience to gain max reward points by using UPI cc. Using a tata nue as LTF since last year. So far tried couple of upi apps like

1. Cred - My default CC bill payment app. Useless cred coins we all know how it is 🥲
2. Tata Nue app - bit slower in terms of loading the qr screen. 
3. Super money - reward points varies as per paid amount.  No rewards from upi money transfer. Cash reward and can be transferred to bank account 
4. Phonepe - account deleted. Bloated but nothing can beat cred 🤪
5. Kiwi - bad experience. Despite having a cibil score of 790 kiwi didn't accept my form and after that the app became useless as I had lost access to the qr payment option too. 
6. Samsung pay - being a galaxy user it's quite convenient but don't understand their reward system.  +1 for their quick access from home screen. 
7. Apay- Good since I also own a ICICI card. Not sure about upi cc rewards.

My goal is to keep just one upi app for most the features including bill and qr based payment. BTW having following banking app too

Rupay UPI credit card doubt ,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1htd5ia/rupay_upi_credit_card_doubt/,2025-01-04,"Hi all,

I have a very simple requirement of RuPay UPI but am not able to find a suitable card. 

Requirements : 

1. LTF/ fee reversal on spends upto 50k p.a.
2. Should be RuPay UPI enabled.
3. Should give lounge access. 
4. Preferably cash-back around 0.5-1% but reward points also work if their conversion is around 0.5-1%

I have found IDFC millennia as a LTF card but on UPI payment below 2000/- gets 1x rewards so its only a 0.25 returns. 

Axis Ace seems to be perfect but I’m not sure if I can use the RuPay version on Iphone Gpay and if the 1.5% cash-back is valid on UPI. 

Note: Kiwi isn’t available on my pincode and neu I’m not eligible for infinity with my 6LPA salary and dont want to be stuck with the tata app.

Please just suggest a good card thanks.

"CRED Refunded ₹27,000 to the Wrong Bank Account – Need Help!",https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jg1raf/cred_refunded_27000_to_the_wrong_bank_account/,2025-03-20,"
Hi everyone, I’m facing an issue with CRED and need some advice on how to resolve it.

Background:

Before I turned 18, my father updated my number on his SBI account so I could use it for transactions on his behalf as he was working outside of India at the time and my mom didn’t really understand banking stuff. 

Since I was using this account, I had added it to my CRED app along with my own personal bank account of Axis Bank which I had opened in early twenties as a salary account. 

The Issue:
I made a ₹27,000 payment on 27th Feb via CRED from my SBI (under my dad’s name) account towards my Axis Bank credit card bill.
The transaction failed, and CRED refunded the amount, but instead of returning it to the source account (SBI), they mistakenly credited it to my Axis Bank savings account (which I rarely use and had a negative balance).
Because of this mistake, I haven’t actually received the refunded money in my SBI account, and it was instead adjusted against the negative balance in my Axis Bank account.

What I’ve Done So Far:
I reached out to CRED support, but they haven’t been helpful in fixing the issue. I sent an email to grievance officer but all i received was automated response saying escalate this t grievance officer by clicking here but then when I click at the shown link its asking for a ticket. I dont have a ticket at all. I called them and asked to raise a ticket the agent said they credited to account which was quicker. They wanted to ensure quick refund so they didn’t think it was important to credit money back to source account. Which is clearly under my fathers name. They had justified this mistake by saying i kept Axis as my primary account so it was ok for them. Is it really ok?

I also contacted Axis Bank, but they say they can’t reverse it since the money was credited to my account. Its a huge sum for me, I got laid off from my company so this is all i had. I wanted to make this payment and close the card until I get another job. 

Has anyone faced a similar issue with CRED refunds?
What’s the best way to escalate this to get the refund sent to the correct account?
Should I take this up with SBI or RBI complaints?
Would appreciate any guidance on how to get CRED to fix this. Thanks in advance!

Realised it on 16th morning and immediately paid the bill (via CRED).

Now I know there's a 3 day extension period specified by RBI starting after the last day which should mean until 16th I should've had time to pay the bill and until then no charges should've been levied but I see that the bank has charged me ₹250 for late payment + ₹45 IGST and the bill payment hasn't yet reflected in the statement while info in CRED says the bank has confirmed the payment and would reflect 16th as the payment date.

I don't know whether the charges were levied at the start of the day or then end and idk if it'll be reversed once the payment starts appearing. What am I more concerned about is

1.  Credit score - how much of an impact should I be expecting?
2. The exact deal with the last payment date rule - Shouldn't the 16th March EOD (23:59:59) be considered the last date for the payment which is 3 days after the end of 13th March? There must be a deterministic rule about this, how can I make my case in case they are not reverted back...

Supercard x Myntra Query,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j5oy86/supercard_x_myntra_query/,2025-03-07,"Hello guys, had a small query regarding the payment offers that Myntra was showing me on checkout.  
As you can see in the image below, those are the options that I am able to see. The options in the red striked off box are something that I donot have access to.

Recently I got my hands on my first CC which is the **Supercard** from Supermoney (FD Backed to generate and build credit score). One of the benefits is **5% flat CB on Myntra**.  
So while looking at this list of available options, the most that makes sense to me is **10% CB on BHIM App & Rupay CC on UPI Txns**. There doesnt seem to be conditions of minimum purchase of so&so and max CB upto so&so. Please do correct me if I am wrong. So effectively that gives me 10% CB on Bhim + 5% CB on Supercard = 15% total

However the other options of ""Upto 500 CB on Rupay CC via Phonepe/Paytm/Cred"" seem very tempting but since its ""UPTO"" I could very well be just getting 1 INR too isnt it? With the BHIM App Rupay CC option I am guaranteed 10% BHIM CB + 5% Supercard CB

Would really appreciate if you guys can share your experience and which payment option would be optimal. I do shop quite a bit on Myntra, previously just did UPI txns but now slowly getting into the CC and CB game.

Thank you

Payment delay,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j1tak2/payment_delay/,2025-03-02,"Today on March 2, I had the ghory realisation that I had missed my cc bill. This can never happen because I have cheq and cred which remind me periodically. Due to better reward, I pay bill on cheq and then mark the bill paid in cred. The bill due date was 28 February.

So I paid earlier but it bounced. Now I have made fresh payment on March 2. Hopefully I am within grave period and won't get to see any interest penalty etc. if anyone has been in this situation, please let me know if I should write an email to customer care and clarify this beforehand or just wait and watch.

Need help understanding and raising dispute in CIBIL report,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1j10967/need_help_understanding_and_raising_dispute_in/,2025-03-01,"So I got to know about the free CIBIL report that we get once a year yesterday from this sub and made an account to check the same.

I have three issues:

• When Cred started showing CIBIL scores, I checked my score there on 26th Feb, it was 760, after that when I checked my report on 1st March on CIBIL website, it showed the score as 746, but I have only had two very small transactions in the past 2-3 days, so any ideas on what the reason for the drop could be? (I have 100% on-time payments)

• It shows the last payment on one of my cards was in Oct 2024, but I have been paying the bills every month on time, as mentioned above.

• I got a limit extension on the same card as above on 10th Feb, but the report still shows the old limit, despite clearly mentioning that the last update CIBIL received was on 15th Feb.

Lastly, I would like help on how to dispute all of these. Thanks in advance :)

TL;DR
Free Credit Report on CIBIL website shows score drop of 14 point in just three days after checking on Cred, no major transactions, on time payments. One credit card's data shows old limit which is increased now and wrong date of last payment (have made monthly payments on time).","['Scores will go up or down whenever a new account is added or high credit or increase in utilization. \nWith regards the late payment mail your banks customer care with a soft copy of the report from cibil mentioning the control number and ask them to correct it.\n\nWith regards the limit increase they would have reported it on 15th feb and should be visible by next week', ""Okay, thanks!

I need urgent advice regarding a payment issue with CRED and ICICI Bank.

I’ve reached out to CRED support, but I need proof of the payment being transferred to ICICI and guidance on how to make the bank acknowledge it. ICICI is being adamant, and I’m worried this might affect my credit score.

Unless you mention the approximate expenses, their categories and the methods, it's very difficult to suggest something\n\nAlso, when you're spending 1L+ monthly, the card doesn't need to be LTF.

From what I can glean here, if you're booking flights often, go for cards like Axis Atlas or Regalia Gold. For online shopping, SBI Cashback. You already have Swiggy for food, but because you already have a co-branded card, it is highly unlikely that HDFC would issue her a core card like Regalia Gold.

Is she a salaried employee, and if so, where does she have the salary account? That bank would be most likely to provide her with the best card possible.

Need help with Cred app malpractices,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1izektc/need_help_with_cred_app_malpractices/,2025-02-27,"Hi All, 

So I used Cred last time in 2019 and then uninstalled the app as due to their mistaken calculation or redeposit in my credit card I had to start the year with my money held by bank. It was actually their money so fair they should get that back, I just had start of the year with a bad feeling that's it. I was new to earning my money so really didn't check account, expenses and hence never checked credit card deposits and stuff. 

Now I remember I had dropped them email about this experience and along with that asked them to drop my account details as I no longer intended to use it. 

Today I got 1 rupee credited to my account, I got suspicious and called my bank and they told it's deposited by Cred. First of all this doesn't make sense, what are they checking with this? Secondly I don't want them to use my financial details. 
I went ahead installed their app to remove/delete anything they might have on me. 

But their app doesn't allow you to login using existing account WITHOUT AGREEING TO allow your credit information. 
I don't want to allow them to do that anymore. 

Please help how can I get my data, account details and this undue relationship removed from Cred. 

I have already emailed them about this but no response yet.

Want to know a way to end my relationship with Cred, get my financial details deleted on their side without agreeing to their stupid design to agree to terms and conditions again, which involves access to credit report.

IMPORTANT: Scam Alert - Axis Bank Holders,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1izc1mi/important_scam_alert_axis_bank_holders/,2025-02-27,"Got a call today from some guy claiming to be ""Vikas"" from Axis Bank – Indiranagar Branch. He already had my PAN card details and credit limit (not the card number) and told me I was eligible for a credit limit upgrade through the Axis Bank app. Seemed legit at first—I mean, who else would have that kind of info other than the bank, right?

But then he sent me a WhatsApp link to a website: appxis.in—which, if you glance quickly, looks dangerously close to the real Axis Bank domain. That’s when the red flag hit. I knew instantly this guy was a scammer. Didn’t click the link. Didn’t fall for it.

I called him out on his bullshit, and guess what? Dude lost it, started hurling abuses, and then hung up.

So yeah, if you get a call from this number (screenshot attached) or anyone claiming to be from your bank, pushing links on WhatsApp—triple-check before doing anything. Don’t share any personal details, OTPs, or log in through sketchy links.

Now, here’s what’s really bothering me:

1) How the hell did this guy get my PAN and credit limit? I only check my credit score on OneScore and CRED, nowhere else. How secure is our data with banks and financial service providers?

2) Who takes responsibility when an unaware person falls for this? If a scammer has inside access to sensitive info, shouldn’t banks be held accountable? Or do we just have to live with the fact that our financial data is floating around in the wild?

This isn’t just a one-off case—if these guys have my details, they probably have yours too. So stay sharp, spread the word, and if you ever get a sketchy call like this, report it ASAP.

Poll- would you pay for this cred/cheq alternative?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1iz80dx/poll_would_you_pay_for_this_credcheq_alternative/,2025-02-27,"I feel there are a few issues with Cred/cheq and similar apps.

1. Privacy point of view - They require complete access to your email, for Amex they ask you to provide Amex username password.

2. Too much bloat/ugly UX - Because they are a free product they try to cross sell you a lot , with so many ads and stupid gamification .  Core functionality is hidden.

3. Not really built for “premium segment” customers. I.e They claim it’s an exclusive app targeting the 1 percent, but I’m pretty sure the 1 percent does not care about cred coins , and quick loans that cred keeps trying to sell you.


So given all this, here is a pitch . Imagine an app
- Does not require access to your email or sms.
- Only Helps you pay , manage and view all credit card bill. 
- Gives you some basic analytics on whether you’ve been charged fees etc.
- No other service. Just credit card management.

However, the app will cost you 99rs per year in subscription fee.

I do this by settling the balance every week. I started doing this initially because of the low limit and wanted to avoid the high utilization in my credit report.

Pixel card is the worst of them all and hdfc is using tactics to charge late fees.,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1iwrv18/pixel_card_is_the_worst_of_them_all_and_hdfc_is/,2025-02-24,"I have a pixel go card, I have used it only 2 times as I have other main card that I use. 

Both the times, during the last few days of the due date the app starts malfunctioning, so you cannot open the cards section and THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER WAY TO MAKE PAYMENT. 

The first time this happened, I thought I will try to make payment later, and then completely forgot about it, there were no texts about reminding the last date of payment so it led me to miss a small ass payment of just Rs. 4200 for the first time in my life. I was reminded of it by call from hdfc card recovery and they sent me some link to make payment, I didn’t think about any foul play here, ok. 

Now this month, the exact same thing happened, the app started giving me errors a couple of days before my due date (22 feb), I tried multiple times during those days and same issue happened. This time I tried to add it to HDFC bank neft payment but you cannot add it or make payment from there, couldn’t add it to cred or phonepe or amazon pay either. So there is absolutely no other way to make a payment apart from payzapp app. 

I raised a ticket about this on 21feb and was promised resolution by 22feb but received no reply from there till today, there is no call based customer support, there is no chat based customer support for immediate assistance. So basically using every tactic in book to extract that late fees? 

Magically the app started functioning on 23feb and I was able to make payment. 

The biggest problem is that they deduct limit from your main hdfc credit card while assigning this cars but then when I tried to request cancellation it says that limit will not be reversed and it is gone! WTF. 

TLDR: pixel go trying every trick in the book to extract late fees and spoiled cibil.

- cannot add it to cred or pay using other platforms, not even hdfc bank.

I’m about to become an NRI and planning to open an NRE/NRO account while closing/converting my federal bank savings account. I currently hold the following credit cards and loan accounts:

#Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card – Using it for the last 4.5 years, upgraded twice automatically, now at ₹6.5L limit. This is my main card for all spending.


#OneCard (Federal Bank) – Using for 2 years, upgraded once, now at ₹5.1L limit.


#CRED Cash Line – ₹5L credit line at 17% interest p.a. (I know CRED is bad, but this might come in handy in a bad day).

Everything except APay-ICICI is mostly for backup.


My questions:

1.	Can I continue using these credit cards and loan accounts after becoming an NRI? Or will they get closed once my savings account is converted to NRE/NRO?

2.	is it possible to convert these into NRI-friendly credit cards?

Paid bill via Cred and unsure if it's paid or not,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1iveani/paid_bill_via_cred_and_unsure_if_its_paid_or_not/,2025-02-22,"Here’s the situation:

1. My first SBI credit card bill was ₹4,365.


2. I paid the full amount through CRED (via UPI + CRED balance). CRED shows Payment Successful, and the payment date is confirmed.


3. In the SBI Card app, it shows the Total Due as ₹4,365 with a green ""Paid"" tag—so it looks like the payment has been received and processed.


4. Google Pay, however, still shows the bill as unpaid, even though it’s been 20 days since I paid.


5. I also checked my credit card transaction history, and the payment is listed there, meaning SBI has indeed received the amount.



Why is Google Pay still showing the bill as unpaid? Is this just a sync delay, or could there be another reason?

Best Credit Cards for Movie Tickets?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ii8r1n/best_credit_cards_for_movie_tickets/,2025-02-05,"Hi everyone,  
  
First-time poster here! I’m looking for recommendations on credit cards that offer good deals on movie tickets. I recently noticed on BookMyShow that banks like Yes Bank and IndusInd are promoting offers like ""buy one get one free"" or discounts of ₹100 or less on tickets.

Also, I came across an offer on CRED for a lifetime-free IndusInd credit card. Has anyone here used it or any other credit card specifically for movie discounts? Would love to hear your experiences or suggestions!

Thanks in advance!","['Open BMS.

Paid CC bill of 2.25L with various apps and here are the details,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ii86yo/paid_cc_bill_of_225l_with_various_apps_and_here/,2025-02-05,"Alright so I've seen several posts on how to maximize cashback or rewards while paying a big CC bill. There's no simple way to do it unless some targets you with a specific offer. Here is the breakdown on how I paid a 2.25L bill: (I won't include which payment method I used since that would make it more complicated)

IND money:

Amount - Cashback

15002 - 38
17350 - 19
10000 - 12
12000 - 12
13000 - 16
10000 - 13
12000 - 14
12000 - 13
20000 - 18
11000 - 8
10000 - 42

This is random so you can get any amount upto 1000 i guess and the cashback can be used to pay next bill. 

Cred:

10000 - 4
10000 - 3

The most useless one among all. 

Cheq:

10000 - 100

I haven't used cheq in a while but I got a WhatsApp offer where next payment above 1000 would earn me 1000 cheq coins which is ₹100, and it can be used to pay next bill.

Bajaj pay:

5000 - 50

Offer of 50 CB for 1st ever cc payment via UPI. 

MobiKwik:

5000 - 15 saved via using super cash

I think this is a little complicated.. as you earn 1% supercash using a couple on every payment. I had some super cash and when I tried paying a bill it had a coupon to apply 15 super cash and it's off the bill 

And I paid a few thousand via Paytm for some specific offers but that's for cashback points. 

Anyway that's how I paid the bill. I know a lot of people prefer convenience and would like to pay the bill in one or two payments and that's upto each of us. I probably won't do it like this all the time but I just wanted to try. 

I used CRED to track the bill, if I pay some amount via another app, I just select mark bill as paid option and enter that amount so it's deducted and correct balance would show.

ALL of the apps instantly credited the bill to card.","['CC bill cashback is dead with Airtel and SBI removing the Debit Card payment option.

Cred is scam! Coin Rush!,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1igqr6v/cred_is_scam_coin_rush/,2025-02-03,"Been using cred for years now! I have accumulated good 50 lacs coins in it.

To my surprise all the items seemed sold out to me while it was buyable for my friend. I don't know what scam is that and why do they even try. Their coins are worth 0 value literally. 

Eventually I ended up buying a lot of vouchers over the course of 3 days and surprise surprise!! They are scam vouchers. The whole game is really that they are applicable on few items of the brand, not all! And these are items which no one wants to buy so they sell these off periodically in campaigns like these. That's not the point though, same vouchers are available on coupons and countless other websites, so it's not that CRED gave you anything exclusive either. I was even surprised that most of the vouchers people were just posting on reddit they found from different apps or offer.

Best platform for credit card bill payment rewards?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hpjz9o/best_platform_for_credit_card_bill_payment_rewards/,2024-12-30,"https://preview.redd.it/7xdh2aj9ly9e1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a078e79b012ab93c3ec74a86662b5440cd2abd

Saw a lot of posts in the last week, regarding the most rewarding app for credit card bill payment. Below is my analysis based on payments I have done on all apps and discussions with my friends and colleagues.

Assuming you are paying the bill of Rs 30K monthly on 1 card (for keeping the calculation easy). 

|Platform|First time|2nd onwards|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cred|\~Rs. 20-30|\~Rs. 2-3|
|Cheq|1% coins worth Rs 30|1% coins worth Rs 30|
|Mobikwik|Rs 100|Rs 40 (pay full amount)|
|INDmoney|\~ Rs 150|\~ Rs 40 - Rs 60|

I think INDmoney is a new platform, so they are giving more cashback. I have accumulated Rs 761 cashback in last 5 months.

Some tips to get more cashback:

1. If you are transacting for the first time, go with the higher amount, guess everyone wants cream users.
2. Always try to **pay your bill in full in one transaction** on any platform the chance of getting rewarded will always be higher(For Cred & INDmoney) - they do not want you to do payments on multiple platforms.

Credit card payment,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hmiuhq/credit_card_payment/,2024-12-26,"I’m facing an issue while paying my credit card bill.

I got a bill of ₹29,601 for my HDFC Tata Neu Plus credit card. To avoid late payment fees due to rounding issues (since they round off the amount), I decided to pay ₹29,602 instead. However, when I tried paying through CRED, it didn’t allow me to pay the full ₹29,602.

So, I split the payment. First, I paid ₹1,602, which was successfully credited to my credit card. Then, I tried paying the remaining ₹28,000, but it stayed in processing overnight, and the next day, the amount was refunded to me.

Today, I tried again to pay ₹28,000, but the app forced me to pay ₹27,999 instead. I paid another ₹1,000, leaving me to attempt ₹27,000 for the remaining balance. However, this payment is now stuck in processing again, and I suspect it will also get refunded by the end of the day.

Even IndMoney is not letting me to pay extra 1rupee.
if this amount get refunded will try through cheq and last i will try hdfc app itself.
Last month only i paid extra for my icici. now im facing this issue

I need some advice from you all.

I have a small business of withdrawing money from credit card and also rotation of credit cards for customers who cannot pay the bill amount. Basically who all are stuck in credit card debt. Which is quite better than paying 35-40% Interest and Late fees with GsT levied.

So, to transfer money to their card I currently use credit and cheq, but they are not rewarding.

Please give me some portals which gives super rewards when we pay bills.

Also, give me some of the best credit cards, as I am thinking of an infinite money glitch where I am taking out money at 2% and if any CC gives more than 2% cashback. It will be a money printing technique.

Why use Cred or Cheq?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1g4vkby/why_use_cred_or_cheq/,2024-10-16,"I have been following this sub for a while and have noticed a general consensus that stands against both Cred and Cheq. In my opinion, the issue with Cred/Cheq is that money transfer to the bank for bill payment is not instantaneous (like it is if you pay on their app) and *sometimes* the bank does not receive the money on time and you, the cardholder, have to face a fine and a headache in resolving the issue. 

Now, I don't care for points or 5 rupee cash back from them upon bill payment. What I care for is to get a reminder for my cards' payment and to be able to see my expenditure across all cards in a single app interface. What I wonder is can you not have an app that allows you to pay card bill using a payment aggregator like SBI or Bank of Baroda? Those of you who are either accountants or have paid GST/TDS/ESIC/PF/Stamp duty dues for a company are definitely familiar with these payment gateways. Their UI is certainly not as fascinating as RazorPay's but they always get the work done (not to mention you don't have to wait ""1-2 days"" for your bank to receive the money). I also found out that all banks have an API/developers portal for fintech opportunities. 

Therefore, is it not possible to:

* Create an app
* Use bank APIs to query credit card information for a user (after due verification)
* Display that information to the user, including card number, bank, amount spent, points earned, etc
* Allow the user to pay the bill using this app by going through an aggregator like SBI?

Given how American Express is a bank by themselves, it’s unlikely for them to have the need to switch to BBPS, compared to other credit cards issued through aggregators like Visa / MasterCard; while the actually-issuing banks would be, for example - SBI, HDFC, ICICI, and so on. 

If I understand it correctly, the BBPS rule applies to banks based in India, which means AmEx is excluded for the rule, at-least for now.

 Why was my HDFC CC Application Rejected? ,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1faa2yq/why_was_my_hdfc_cc_application_rejected/,2024-09-06,"So one day I open my Swiggy and I see that I am eligible for LFT Swiggy HDFC CC. Not that I need it (Infinia gives 15% RP on Swiggy GC on Gyftr), I was like what the heck, who says no to LTF cards and I applied. To my surprise, HDFC rejected my application.

Why surprised?

1. My salary is 1cr+
2. I own HDFC Infinia and Magnus (I know I need to discontinue this now) both with 10L limit. I also have Tata Neu Infinity LFT
3. My CIBIL Score is 791, my CRIF is 860
4. I pay my taxes
5. I had Imperia Account (which was a sales scam) so I moved to Preferred (moved my balance to SFBs)
6. I hardly use Magnus so 10L intact limit and use Infinia upto 2\~5L spends based monthly.
7. I am debt free (no loans, no EMI)

So what was so wrong in my profile that I was rejected?

Only thing I can think of is:

1. I maximized the benefits hard. Like have earned 10L+ reward points from Infinia
2. Travel a lot so have used PP really nicely even like going to multiple lounges at same airport at same visit, like say lounge two has lemon ice-cream 
3. I always pay the bills on last day making more of free credit days by putting that money in Overnight Funds  and always use Cheq or Cred to pay get bit more

So logically I am a loss to banks but have they started judging application on that criteria?

I recently made a payment for my SBI Credit Card bill of ₹26,399 (the exact amount was ₹26,398.19) through the Cheq app, as it was showing me that amount. Later, I found out that SBI refunded me the exact same amount, and my credit card bill was left unpaid.

I then made another payment of ₹26,398, and it got successfully paid this time. However, since the payment was made 2 days late, SBI has now charged me a late fee penalty of ₹1,100 plus ₹198 as taxes.

Is there any way I can avoid this late fee or request SBI to remove it? I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to handle this situation.

I double-checked my Google account, and Cheq is not listed under the connected apps. I also recalled instances where Cheq notified me about my ICICI statements hours before I even received the official email.

This issue only seems to happen with ICICI, not with other banks. According to Cheq's website, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are their banking partners.

Can anybody confirm this? There might be a chance that the issue would be from google side, and they actually didn’t revoked the access.

[Project Update] Credit Card Rewards India Calculator – New Features Added! 🚀,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1f00zak/project_update_credit_card_rewards_india/,2024-08-24,"Hey everyone! 👋

I am sharing some exciting updates to the Credit Card Rewards India Calculator, the tool I've been working on to help you maximize your credit card rewards across various banks in India.

**Summary of Previous Updates:**

* **Fixed Issues:** HDFC card bugs and other reported issues were fixed.
* **New Additions:** Amex, HSBC, and SBI cards were added to the calculator.
* **Enhanced Structure:** The card structure was improved for better accuracy based on community feedback

**New Updates (as of 24-Aug-2024):**

* **Landing Page:** We've added a brand-new landing page to make navigation smoother.
* **My Cards Page:** Save your cards on the ""My Cards"" page for quicker access.
* **Card Images:** Visual representations of all cards are now included to make it easier to identify them at a glance.

[The app to stop this stuggle](https://preview.redd.it/w5d9w2iytkkd1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b57e5ed99eb92d986cd9ff2d551440eb07bdcd2)

**Upcoming Features:**

* **Multi-Calculator:** I'm working on a multi-calculator feature to suggest the best card based on the Merchant Category Code (MCC) and spends. This will help you maximize rewards even further.

**Data Security & Privacy:** The data is securely stored in Firebase Datastore, and no card numbers are collected. So, you don't need to worry about privacy issues when signing up and trying out the tool. The community can use it confidently and help refine it. The calculator also works without signup if you are not comfortable with it!

**Sharing & Community Involvement:** Please share this tool within your Telegram communities! We can fine-tune the features if users can try them out and report any issues. Rest assured, there are no plans to make this project closed source anytime soon—it's here to stay as an open-source tool for everyone.

Your feedback has been incredibly motivating, and I'd love to hear more! Let me know what you think, any bugs you encounter, or features you'd like to see next. Your input will help shape the future of this project.

Credit Card Fraud Victim,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1etwo9j/credit_card_fraud_victim/,2024-08-16,"Have been unfortunately a victim of a credit card fraud (IndusInd Bank - EazyDiner Card)
I was approached by a person asking me to fill out some details on the app via an apk link shared by this person. Couldn't catch this part, I went on to fill it out and received OTPs and bam, the card was used for Rs1.4L

I immediately blocked the card the next minute and reported it to my bank. They said they'd investigate it. In addition the merchant name is www.cheq.one (it's fake, actual legal merchant name of Cheq is CHEQ DIGITAL PRIVATE Limited).
I kept telling the customer care that this merchant is an obvious fake and will they be able to refund or not, on which they asked me to file a Cyber Crime complaint as well.

Is there a scope of a refund/chargeback? As the bank told me it was also a secured transaction. Does RBI guidelines work in my favour here?

Also, after doing a few small test payments, the update after more than a week is - *cashback was not credited to the Platinum Card on HDFC.* **This proves that credit card cashback has now come to an end on HDFC Billpay.**

===

There were some recent discussions amongst the comment section under some posts in this subreddit regarding pretty much what it says in this post’s title.

Is this true? I heard that this happened effective from 24-July-2024.

Kindly confirm through evidence and if so, this would be a huge blow tbvh.

===

**Suggested alternative:**

Folks can use CheQ to pay-off their Credit Cards, which will get you an effective reward redemption rate of 0.001%. This is significantly less compared to HDFC Billpay, but CRED gives you even worse (because there, it's a lottery anyway). Plus, that even if you are okay with the recent Privacy-related stuff happening around CRED.

However, do read on for a few important points...

**How does it work on CheQ:**

* Say you spent Rs. 10,000/- on a Credit Card Bill Payment. You'll get 100 CheQ Chips (1% return rate, but this is gets worse...since this is the Gross Return Rate).
* Now, when you are doing the subsequent Credit Card Bill Payment, you'll be able to redeem those 100 CheQ Chips; which will give you a redemption of Rs. 10 (so Net Return Rate is 0.1%)
* It is important to know that there is a **monthly cap of 4000 CheQ Chips that a user can earn.**
* Therefore, Rs. 4L is the maximum combined Credit Card Bill Payment a person can do via CheQ, which will max-out that platform (4000 CheQ Chips earned = Rs. 400 valuation 😂 I mean, I guess it's not zero so okay hahah)

**When you have maxxed-out CheQ and still have any remaining Credit Card Bill Outstanding (beyond Rs. 4L) -**

* So upon spending a minimum of Rs. 1,000 on Credit Card Bill Payments; CRED gives you random, lottery-based rewards that one can use for subsequent Credit Card Bill Payments.
* This means, there is no need to pay the entire Outstanding Amount on CRED (this is important). It's not like they'll give you a huge cashback if you do a huge transaction, and we all know this at this point so 🤡
* You already know what to do now: do multiple transactions of Rs. 1,000 only; across multiple cards (if you have) and on a daily basis (which means you need to start paying-off the bill about a week prior to the Due Date).
* As per my experience, the average limit of cashback per card is 5-ish per month.
* However, if you have 10+ cards like me, it doesn't mean you'll get 50 spins at the cashback lottery. The most you may get would be somewhere between 10-15, in a single month.

I have seen and tried to reply to all the comments in my bill payment post, but most of the suggestions were not practical as they require several debit cards, multiple accounts, and a lot of hassle.

The best approach is to have a platinum debit card from HDFC and a credit card from another company. You can pay the credit card bill using the HDFC debit card. However, keep in mind that the HDFC platinum debit card has an annual fee of ₹899 and a joining fee of ₹899 with GST.

Today, I tried paying ₹10,000 twice through CRED and received ₹6 as cashback. After realizing this was very painful, bothersome, and not worth risking my financial info for ₹100-200 that I wouldn't actually get from CRED without making more transactions through another app, I downloaded Cheq but uninstalled it immediately after some research. 

I then paid the remaining amount through the HDFC mobile banking app and felt at peace.

4. ICICI Sapphiro Mastercard
5. ICICI Amazon Pay
6. ICICI Rupay
7. HDFC 6E world Mastercard
8. One card South Indian Bank Visa signature

Slightly Unpopular Credit Card Related Opnions,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1crf3qn/slightly_unpopular_credit_card_related_opnions/,2024-05-14,"-Its too dayum difficult to get an American Express credit card. If I share my personal experience after providing them with my bank statement, my past three month salary slips, my ITR fillings they still asked for two more proofs of income. Its too big a hassle for a card half of India wont accept. I get it you get referrals and gifts and all. But honestly its like luring kids into Omni with toffee. 

AmEx is like the Amway of credit card world. Its better to opt for other cards than this. For SmartEarn the minimum income is 4.5 LPA. I was 20 my first salary was 14k and HDFC offered me Moneyback with 40k limit still grateful for that. Amex has one thing and one thing only. Its name.

-Cred is fine. People need to stop dissing on it. I know people who have won free TV sets via Cred. Yesterday I made two bill payments got like Rs. 12 sometimes I get 1. The whole point of credit cards was to make life easier and rewarding. People need to chill out. Pay your bills and relax not every aspect of our being shall earn us rewards. Those with credit cards are already getting better offers and deals that should be enough. 

The main motive with Cred should always be easy bill payments. Fast and reliable. Thats its. Also to those who shall come up with Cheq or Mobikwik or HDFC RBL Cards. Its simple not worth it. Not everyone has an account in HDFC I personally got it closed. Pay through your cards and relax with the bills.

-People make a big deal of conversion ratios, partner points. Booking Accor hotels, flights. The prices for those are already ramped up. So no big deal, if you try booking through a good travel agent you would get a better deal. Im surprised all these credit card enthusiasts never talk about. Also I always wonder how these people go on vacation this much. I dont get the time to simply do it maybe my bad.

I personally have seen that HDFC SmartBuy and Axis Grabdeals sometimes offer higher rates for stuff than others. So it really isnt worth the extra points if the prices have gone high. Tried this with Myntra. You could see for yourself and you shall see the difference.

-No one bank or credit card issuer sucks. Everyone make mistakes. Happens . Move on. You do what best gets you started. No need to follow on in others footsteps or get influenced by others.

-Simple cards are the best. Straightforward rewards no siyapa. 

-Swipe, tap, enjoy. Its a tool to make life manageable and easy. Not a game we have to play on repeat.

-MoneyBack sucks but it was a good start for many. 

-Comparing what you have to be and give to het Infinia it doesn’t matter. It’s a super premium card for the elites. It doesn’t matter how good it is when most of us cant get it.

-Also a-lot of people ask this rate my credit card collection on this sub. Buddy you have it. Are you happy.? If you are stay that way. You don’t need validation from strangers.

The Ultimate beginners guide to Credit cards,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jmmylv/the_ultimate_beginners_guide_to_credit_cards/,2025-03-29,"Let me make it clear why I am writing this post. The latest post about a guide to beginners' credit card pit-falls/Traps was written a month ago [Link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i4wbfp/a_guide_for_credit_card_beginners_common_traps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

And today [u/sidthefreak](https://www.reddit.com/user/sidthefreak/) wrote a Rant about people asking about which card do I need to choose. Or how do I start my cc journey etc.. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/rHRqOXaeY2)

Before all the Credit card explanations and how to get it you need to know some basics and abbreviations.

CC - Credit Card LTF - Life Time Free FYF - First Year Free Cobranded - These cards are collabs with different brands and banks APAY - amazon pay credit card CB- Cash Back card(this amount is usually credited to the next statement or wallet for co-branded cards.) EMP - Emerald Private Metal card (Icici) DCB- Diners Club Black card (HDFC) RM - Relationship manager (Bank employee who is appointed to you.)

What is cibil score: - Its is a number between 300 to 900. which is used to measure quality of credit usage of the customer. (Thats the gist of it google to know more. Higher the score the better.)

Here is a guide on how I would do it if I started my journey again. There will be 2 parts to it. so read it accordingly.

Part 1:- For students or people attained the age of 18 and are eager to get a credit card.

Part 2:- For Salaried individuals/self-employed who want to enter the cc game (Age does not effect this unless you are above 60Y).

Watch part will have a subpart A, B read it accordingly. I am peeling a banana and putting it in your mouth don't spit it out eat it properly.

**Part 1:** 

**STUDENTS**

**Sec A Those who never took a loan from a loan app( really stupid loan apps that charge 11-16% interest). If you did take a loan read sec B.**

Yha yha, guys and girls calm down. Take a breath and hold your horses. Read this carefully. It is the beginning of your credit history, Trust me you don't want to mess it up. After 4 or 6 years when your study is done and you want to buy a house and take a loan, the bank will ask 2 things(Mostly) Your income, Your cibil score. ([How to guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1fyxa5r/how_to_check_credit_score_for_free_without/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Don't check it just yet continue reading.) If your cibil is bad Banks might reject your application or give you a loan at a higher interest rate.

So now you understand the gravity of the situation. There is no better way to do it. starting cc game. Here is how many members including me did it and succeeded(Do it at your own risk I am not responsible for anything you do.) Banks won't trust you just yet cause your initial cibil score is -1 which states that you never took a loan/cc in your life.

To gain the bank's trust you can get a secured/FD backed cc. This means that you'll need to do a fixed deposit and get a cc. Different banks have different rules on the amount of fd required etc. You can get any card if you are absolutely clueless you can always google, every bank usually has one. Here are some of the popular fd backed cards (IDFC WOW(20k Fd),icici platinum(50k fd)). There are Some cards that give you a cc on 2k or even 1k fd but it is highly suggested that you don't go for those cards. Better get a card from a reputed bank to get upgrade offers (And if you get a 1k fd card to maximise cibil score building you’ll need to use only 30% limit which means only 300/- per month). If you want refe\*als li\*ks you can ask the members of this sub to get joining benefits.

After you get an FD-backed cc you need to wait 2 or 3 months (depending on when you applied and when you get approved for the cc) to check if your cibil is updated. It'll usually land between 650 -750 range. 

Now what you'll do is wait. Ok here me out. Don't do stupid sh\*t with the cc. Pay the **total amount due**(very important). Every month try and use only 30% or less of the credit limit(Not using it will also affect the cibil score). Now wait at least 6 to 9 months. You'll usually receive calls that you are approved for this cc and that cc from call centre. Don't apply for those cards they'll usually reject you(no income & less than 1 year credit history) the last thing you want is a rejected cibil enquiry.

Optionally you can open accounts in banks in which you want a cc and open a savings account with them. And start using that account to make the daily transactions. You might get a pre-approved offer in a few months and then apply to it.(Make sure its pre-approved it won't ask you for salary slips/itr only ekyc to get this card this was also optional in my case.) you'll get offers form Amazon Pay Later or others like these you can take them as an alternative if you don't get a pre-approved offer. But I highly suggest you don't apply for those it's easy to lose track of them in your early stages.

You wont get approved to the EMP or DCB cards just yet you'll need to start earning for that. Some colleges have tie-ups with banks and offer cc to uni students this is one of the best ways to get premium cards without income proof. Make sure to visit nearby branches and ask them( also look it up in google.)

**Sec B Those who took a loan from a loan app and defaulted it (i.e not paid it)**

Man, I know you have a stupid half-knowledge baked friend who suggested this app. Don't take me wrong but cut all ties with him/her. You don't need his help any more he did too much good till now. 

Take my suggestion and settle it or pay in full if you can. Try requesting if they can take away the bad report from your cibil (I know it's a long shot but its worth a try.) The process is the same as part A to get a cc. But i just wanted to let you know that you can check your cibil score and it'll most probably be in the lower end <550 or something like that. You'll need to wait at least 7 years to get approval for a good cc(Not compulsory but this is usually the case.)

**Part 2:-**

**Sec A**

Salaried members Those who don't have bad cibil or do not have cibil at all. Same as the student part A but check your bank app to see if you have any pre-approved offers. You might have some. If not you can usually apply to any bank if you have a good salary you’ll be approved. But don't apply for too many at once. Apply for 1 at a time if you get rejected don't apply again for at least 6 months.(Not compulsory but a good practice.) 

**Sec B**

Bad cibil score or default in the past.

Same as student part B. And be careful this time around.

Thank you to all those who read this far. Especially the members of this sub who already own a cc. I am pretty new here so show me some mercy and correct my mistakes if any in the comments I'll edit. And give me suggestions on which abbreviations I have to add to the list. The ones I added were the once I got most confused with in the beginning.

Got all these due to this community!,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1jhyoi8/got_all_these_due_to_this_community/,2025-03-23,"All thanks to this Sub-Reddit, I got all these cards. Got most of these in the last six months. 

Cards with annual fee are: SBI Cashback, SimplySave, HSBC Live+ and Axis Airtel. All others are LTF. 

Some cards may appear to be redundant, but there’s a reason why I got them.

1. ICICI Platinum: I had to get this to get the Amazon card. The local branch manager told me that if I get Platinum and wait for three months and apply for Amazon online on Amazon website, I’ll get it immediately. This is what happened. Got credit limit of 4L.

2. SBI SimplySave: The agent misled me and told me that I need to get this for Cashback as Cashback is not issued as the first SBI card. I took it, but later complained to SBI in a long email, and they immediately gave me the Cashback card with credit limit of 3.59 L

3. Yes Bank Uni NX Wave: I wanted a Zero Forex card, but IDFC was taking their own sweet time to approve Wow Card. So I applied for Uni NX Wave and got it. But I also got Wow card. Kept both as they are LTF. 

4. Axis Airtel, Axis Neo, and ICICI Coral were all pre-approved. I applied for them on their respective Apps and got them allotted immediately. 

Axis FlipKart is my oldest card and I am planning to close it since it is a paid card and I am unable to meet the waiver expense target. After SBI Cashback, this card became irrelevant. 

CIBIL Score was 791 when I started applying for these cards about six months ago. Now it is 779 due to 16 queries during this time. I won’t be apply for anymore cards now since I think I have all I need. CIBIL score should improve over time.

Pre approved AU Ixigo or Uni X Gold Credit card?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ixujvd/pre_approved_au_ixigo_or_uni_x_gold_credit_card/,2025-02-25,"Hi, I have an upcoming trip next year, and I'm looking for a straightforward credit card with zero forex fees for international trip and future purchases. I've narrowed it down to two options: the AU Ixigo Credit Card and the Uni X Gold Credit Card.

My key requirements are a lifetime-free card (since I won’t be using it often, I don't want to keep paying for it) and zero forex markup fees. Extra benefits like lounge access or travel discounts (in Ixigo's case) would be a bonus, but they’re not essential.

A. Why Uni X Gold?
1. Lifetime-free card.
2. Zero forex fees.
3. I've heard that Mastercard offers better rates than Visa cards (based on forum discussions).
4. I don’t have any Yes Bank cards, so I could benefit from merchant discounts with this card. (Please confirm if this is accurate.)
5. 1% cashback on most purchases, which could be useful. (Not sure if this applies to international spends.)


B. Why Ixigo AU Card?
1. Lifetime-free card.
2. Zero forex markup.
3. I don’t have any AU Bank cards, so I could use this for AU merchant discounts.
4. Free lounge access without a spending requirement. (I already have lounge access with other cards, but I could use this for others traveling with me.)



C. How I plan to get a pre-approved AU Ixigo Credit Card?
Please refer to this link for details:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1ixu8hs/can_i_get_a_preapproved_au_ixigo_credit_card/


D. Why not Scapia?
I’m not considering the Scapia credit card because I read that they recently reduced credit limits significantly. Given that, I don’t trust them at the moment, even though they are accepting new applications. However, feel free to convince me otherwise if you think it’s worth applying for.

E. Why not debit cards?
I am looking to avoid TCS payment upfront and getting it back a year later. Though, i already have some debit cards in mind if any of my credit card application fails.


F. Question:
Could you help me decide which zero forex credit card would be better? Should I wait for a pre-approved AU Ixigo card, or apply directly for the Uni X Gold card? I’d really appreciate your thoughts. Thank you!

(PS- I’m not interested in credit cards like the Diners Club Black, which charge a forex markup upfront but offer equivalent cashback in return. I’m looking for a simple, zero-forex-fee card. Hope you understand!)

Regarding what you mentioned, I’ve seen screenshots of the Uni X card app, and it displays the currency rate and the total charged, so I can see the forex markup applied. But with Scapia, something feels off, maybe I’m just being paranoid.\n\n(Another reason for my hesitation is their partnership with Federal Bank. Federal bank seems like this new age neo-bank that’s collaborating with a lot of fintechs. My gut tells me not to get involved with Federal Bank right now, especially in case a new startup emerges. Since Federal Bank only allows one card per customer, and I have other options for getting a zero-forex card, I feel that getting Scapia might limit my chances of getting a fintech card I actually want. If Scapia partnered with other banks, I’d consider it in the future.)', 'See in the end take whatever you’re comfortable with. Like I said Uni x Card I’ve not had any experience so can’t recommend.\n\nElse between AU ixigo and Scapia just on the basis of international spends and overall convenience I would recommend Scapia.']",cred
How i built up credit score as a college student with no credit history or income (not a clickbait).,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1iw3k2h/how_i_built_up_credit_score_as_a_college_student/,2025-02-23,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience of building a credit score from scratch and getting my first unsecured credit card to now owning seven credit cards—all while still being a college student (this is not a flex but just experience of being patient and smart with credit utilization) I hope this helps those who are just starting out or struggling to get approvals.

How It Started

As soon as I turned 18, I got my PAN card and opened two HDFC savings accounts:
	1.	HDFC Savings Max Account (Premium, ₹25K AMB) – Comes with a Platinum Debit Card with lounge access and insurance.
	2.	Regular HDFC Savings Account

For a year, I routed most of my family’s and household transactions through my account. This helped me establish a steady transaction history. I also built a good relationship with an HDFC branch employee, which turned out to be helpful later.

First Credit Card – HDFC Basic Card (₹25K Limit)

After nine months, I asked my HDFC contact if I could get an unsecured credit card (without an FD). Thanks to my banking history, my request was approved, but I got only the most basic HDFC credit card with a ₹25K limit.

I started putting all my expenses on the card, often exceeding the 30% utilization mark because, let’s be honest, 30% of ₹25K isn’t much. I always paid my bills in full and on time.

Building Credit History & Getting Limit Increases
	•	After one year, I got an email to upgrade to HDFC MoneyBack Plus, but my limit remained the same. A bit disappointing, but at this point, I had built a decent credit score.
	•	Another year later, I got a limit enhancement to ₹50K and a free linked UPI credit card (shared limit).
	•	By then, I had already applied for other credit cards, but they kept getting rejected.

First Big Break – Amazon Pay ICICI (₹1.7L Limit!)

After two years of credit history, I applied again for Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card. To my surprise, it got approved with a ₹1.7L limit! This was a game-changer because it offered great value, especially for Amazon Prime users like me.
	•	A month later, ICICI Coral RuPay Credit Card was auto-approved with the same shared limit.
	•	My HDFC card got upgraded to BizPower, but still no limit increase.

More Approvals & Credit Growth

After my ICICI approval, things started rolling:
✅ UNI NX Wave Credit Card – Approved with ₹1.8L limit
✅ HDFC Swiggy Credit Card – Approved
✅ Axis Bank Credit Card – Recently approved
💳 Total Credit Limit Now: ~₹7L
📈 Current CIBIL Score (TransUnion): 781

Key Takeaways from My Journey

1️⃣ Start Early & Build Banking Relationships – A steady transaction history and a good rapport with bank employees helped me get my first card.
2️⃣ Use Your First Card Wisely – Even though my HDFC card had a low limit, I used it regularly and always paid in full.
3️⃣ Be Patient – My first approvals took time, but once I had a 2-year credit history, other banks started approving me.
4️⃣ Pay Bills in Full & On Time – Never missed a single payment, which kept my credit score strong.
5️⃣ Only Spend What You Can Afford – I’ve been lucky to have my parents’ trust, but responsible spending is key.

If you’re starting out, focus on building a solid credit history with responsible spending, and the approvals will come. Hope this helps someone! Feel free to ask any questions.","['Same story!

So Uni SBM NX Wave Card is dead,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1isy0z1/so_uni_sbm_nx_wave_card_is_dead/,2025-02-19,"I received a message regarding that from SBM bank last month, and so I asked Uni and here is the response:

We understand this may come as a surprise. SBM and Uni have mutually agreed to discontinue the co-branded Uni SBM NX Wave credit card program. We sincerely appreciate your trust and support throughout this journey.

After 1st March 2025, your SBM Uni Credit Card will no longer be operational for new spends. However, you will still be able to:

🔹 Repay your pending dues using your card until your billing date, and based on your billing date, it will remain active for repayments until April 1st, 2025.

🔹 Redeem your Uni Coins via the Uni app until 31st March 2025. Any unredeemed coins will reset to zero after that.

​However, we are in the process of introducing new credit cards in collaboration with different banks. Once they become available for your profile, we will notify you via the Uni application and WhatsApp.
","[""Uni has been partnered with Yes Bank since last year. So, I guess they broke off all ties with SBM.

Credit Card Recommendations?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1iskkhi/credit_card_recommendations/,2025-02-18,"I have the following cards currently:

* SBI SimplyClick (Paid)
* SBI Cashback (Paid)
* Axis Cashback Card (Paid / erstwhile Citibank Cashback Card)
* HDFC Millenia (Paid)
* IndusInd EazyDiner (Paid)
* Amazon ICICI (LTF)
* IDFC First Wealth (LTF)
* IDFC Wow (LTF)
* Yes UNI (LTF)

**This is how I am using these cards:**

* **SBI SimplyClick** was my go-to online spends card till **SBI Cashback** came on the picture. Now almost all my online spends are on the latter card, while SimplyClick is only used where a discount on Cashback card is not applicable.
* **Axis Cashback Card** \- Not used. Just keeping a Rs600,000 limit open for use.
* **HDFC Millenia** \- Barely using it since most of my online spends have shifted to SBI Cashback though I did book a couple of air-tickets so I crossed the renewal fee waiver.
* **IndusInd EazyDiner** \- Exclusively for EazyDiner bookings in restaurants. The card has paid itself very quickly.
* **Amazon ICICI** \- Rarely used. Has Rs860,000 limit so keeping it.
* **IDFC First Wealth** \- Rarely used but booked one airticket on EMI to enjoy a one-time discount.
* **IDFC Wow** \- My go to card to swipe abroad to save on forex conversion fees. **Yes UNI** was also taken for the same purpose but where possible, I use Wow when I am abroad.

Last year across cards, I spent almost Rs11 lakhs (out of which \~Rs2lakhs was on SBI Cashback and \~Rs1lakh on the EazyDiner card). 

I wanted to know if I should see to consolidate spends in certain cases (skip the one-time EMI discount on air tickets for example) and so look to put it all on one or two rewarding cards? Which cards should I try for? I am being offered an upgrade for Regalia Gold vs Millenia. Should I opt for it? Any other suggestions?","[""A few questions\n\nWhat are your use case?\n\nWith that kind of spends, are you preferring Cashbacks over Rewards ?\n\nWith the cards like SBI Cashback, Amazon ICICI, HDEC Millennia, I don't think you are completely optimising your spends by simply keeping it in your wallet."", ""I have been focusing on cashback since overall spends have been low for years, so it seemed pointless to chase rewards and spend more to use those rewards to achieve those legendary double digit returns. Now with spends steadily rising and cashback does have its own limits, I am exploring.\n\nMy key use cases are online spends (where SBI Cashback is my go to card - Amazon ICICI and Millenia are rarely used unless there is a specific discount to avail). I even prefer this card to pay via Zomato/Swiggy at restaurants unless I get better deals on EazyDiner (which is when my Indusind EazyDiner card comes into the picture).\n\nThe other use case is solo international travels. Currently I'm using SBI Cashback card wherever possible when it comes to bookings from India while abroad I use my zero forex cards."", 'Maybe you can look into a travel credit card so that they can get you reward points and some free award flights or a few hotel stays.']",cred
Uni Gold X: Zero forex card,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1isjuwa/uni_gold_x_zero_forex_card/,2025-02-18,"This's only an initial review of Uni Gold X card.

I recently had issues with Fi Money. Their customer service was really bad in resolving issues in timely manner. I also maintained \~1L AMB for the prime plan but of no use. So was looking for an alternate Zero forex card. I have the Niyo Global card but since my international spending had already crossed the 5L limit, I can't use the card till April.

  
Cards I considered: Niyo DCB in debit and IDFC First WoW in credit because I recently opened account in IDFC First bank.

My brother came across Uni Gold X when searching and asked me to give it a shot. There's one other review of the card and I just wanted to get out of Fi and was LTF so I applied. 

Application process: Card is LTF for now. I applied through the app, completed VKYC on the same day(Friday). Uni approved on Saturday and Yes bank approved on Tuesday. The card shows as Uni Wave X in emails. But I don't think it's an issue.

The app's UI is okayish, but it keeps logging out. It has a lot of bugs like the limit switch is turned on when I turned it off a while ago. But I tried international transaction and it worked without any issues. Exchange rate was same as on MasterCard and no extra fees was charged (Fi charges 4% and refunds in 2 weeks). 

If anyone is looking for Zero Forex, I think this's one of the cards to consider. Not sure how good the rewards are but I'm not looking at rewards in international transactions anyways. MITC attached below.

Limit offered: 4L  
Previous limits: ICICI APay: 6.8L, HDFC Millenia: 2L - bought this 1 month back.

I’m facing a payment issue, and I need some advice or guidance. Here's the situation:  

I used my HDFC debit card to pay my ICICI credit card bill via the SBI UniPay portal. The payment amount was ₹18,052, and I received a successful payment confirmation. However:  

1. The amount has not been settled against my ICICI credit card yet, and the due date is approaching soon.  
2. The transaction does not appear in the Transaction History section of the SBI UniPay portal, even though I have a screenshot confirming the payment was successful.  

I’ve already emailed both HDFC Support and SBI Support, requesting them to either settle the payment or refund the amount if it’s stuck. I’m now waiting for their response, but I’m worried about late fees or credit score impacts if this isn’t resolved quickly.  

Has anyone else experienced something similar? What steps should I take to escalate this if I don’t get a timely resolution?  

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Need to trim/upgrade my credit card collection. Please give me your suggestions.,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hoab9u/need_to_trimupgrade_my_credit_card_collection/,2024-12-28,"Hi everyone, long time lurker of the community and the tips provided in this community have been immensely helpful in saving me from Forex fees on my recent trip. I came to know about Uni Card and AU Ixigo through the community and these have been fantastic cards. My latest addition to the list was the Airtel Axis credit card that has been very useful since me and my wife are Airtel customers for cellular connection and broadband as well as occasional spends on Swiggy for Instamart.

I have been using credit cards since 10+ Years now so only a good part of these were accumulated over the years but I figured some of these are total duds thus need to close these in the favour of better cards. Suggestions are welcome.

My plan:

Close

* LIC VISA Signature (LTF)
* ICICI RuPay Coral (LTF)
* SBI SimplySave (₹500 PA and reversible only if spends cross ₹100,000)

Apply

* SBI BPCL Card (Since I have high fuel expenses and the ₹50,000 limit will be crossed easily)
* Fi Debit card (Cheap Forex withdrawals fees)
* SBI Cashback card (if possible)

My biggest constant expense has been fuel but that isn't limited only to either IOCL, HPCL or BPCL thus seeking a card for the same. The IDFC Power card has been a poor performer too but keeping it around for a year since I already cross the ₹50,000 annual spends criteria. Other cards such as Standard Chartered, RBL or HSBC come in handy to avail discounts.

Hdfc money back (LTF)- This is base card for hdfc. Currently no use of this card but due to direct in other hdfc cards, I am still having this.

Hdfc swiggy (LTF) - I use this card for the 5 percent cash back it gives on online payment. Also for 10% CB on swiggy. (Currently most used card)

Hdfc Tata Neu infinity (not LTF) - Used to be my go to card before i got hdfc swiggy credit card. Even though I use Tata neu app mostly for Tata 1 mg, currently ordering medicines with Swiggy credit card as CB is same 5 percent.Also, UPI switched to Yes Kiwi credit card. Only usage now is utility bills. Not sure whether i should continue with this card.

Yes Klick kiwi credit card  (LTF)- Using for UPI payments

Icici amazon pay  (LTF)- No use as I ise hdfc swiggy for shipping on amazon 

Indusind legend credit card (LTF)- Never used this card for any expenses as such. Even the for international lounge access, I believe i need to pay extra. So not sure any use of this card

Amex MRCC  (not LTF)- Used to be my primary card till some time back but now it’s usage is reduced dramatically. Even with gold reward programme can get 6k or 9k as cashback with 18000 or 24000 points. So ideally after spending around ₹120000(₹20000 x 6 months) getting just around 18000 points (assuming 3000 points each month). So the base rate of CB is less than 5%

Axis rewards - former citi rewards (not LTF)- Very old card but no use as of now ( need to spend 30k yearly to avoid renewal fees) My home loan is with Axis, should i ask for some other credit card instead of this one.

I would be traveling to Japan and My future expenses would be mostly there, hence was thinking to get a forex credit card but both au ixigo and uni wave got rejected for unknown reasons. Hehe i want suggestion on which credit cards to keep, which to close and anything new that i should get.

Bow down to this community for making me CC smart,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hkr5c2/bow_down_to_this_community_for_making_me_cc_smart/,2024-12-23,"Till October 2024, I had no interest of diving into Credit Cards. Primarily because it took me 5 years to pull my family out of a debt situation (will create another thread on it).

I had a Singapore Trip and even for that I preferred Niyo Debit Card. I [created a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1fotr4f/niyo_dcb_debit_card_vs_prepaid_forex_card_vs_cash/?rdt=64693) for same. But some places didn't have DC working and this entire incident introduced me to this reddit community.

Before October 2024:
1. **ICICI Amazon Pay** (~35K CB in 2024, had quite a few flight journeys)
2. **HDFC Business Moneyback** (got it offered as LTF and got 8.8L limit)
3. **SBI SimplyClick** (it was my first CC) (technically LTF as I get Amazon Voucher for INR 500 annual charge)
4. **Axis MyZone CC** (my second CC, and earlier used to get free domino pizza from points) (again, technically LTF due to voucher)
5. **ICICI Coral Rupay** for UPI and ICICI offers
6. **Yes Bank Uni Wave** 0 Forex LTF CC

Now I get interested and tired of using HP Pay. Turns out there is an almost no nonsense card for petrol cashback, even better rates. I created an entire Excel comparing different CCs. Axis IOCL Premium topped my list but it had mix reviews. So,

7. **SBI BPCL Octane Rupay** in my wife name (Already got 1600 worth petrol and first year waived off because I paid a vendor via UPI and got 1% RP. All of this in 1 billing cycle)

Another thing to add at this point is, until Oct Infinia change, I was eligible for Infinia. But I figured I am a frugal guy (well, mostly) and my biggest expense in last 5 years has been taxes. So,

8. **HDFC Dinners BizBlack** (got 1st year waived off, 1.5L spent, next year waived off, 60k in RP in just 1.5 billing cycle. Dec is Adv Tax month). I am so sad I didnt use it for last 7 years!!! Getting this was a single signature because of 8.8L limit I got automatically.

But hey, all this Infinia thing kinda hit me up that I need a show off card. Also, I needed unlimited lounge for my family of 4. And I have pretty good relationship at ICICI. (I have roughly 16 accounts (Savings and Current) and 2 Home Loans in last 4 years in my close network)

9. **ICICI Sapphiro LTF** for my wife as a safer move

10. Today, got **ICICI Emeralde Private Metal** on iMobile - Single request and one month of wait. And, as my RM updated me, entire ICICI bank's leadership approval (lol! It is as crazy as everyone claims, dont even know for what reason). So yeah, unlimited lounge for my family, domestic and international. 

In 3 months, I have probably super optimised my CC financial part as well. All thanks to this community. I bow down to you all for all those threads, comments and replies. You have shared knowledge that has already saved me 70k in last 1 month. And without changing my spending pattern for Card, thats the best part.

Hi All, 

As the title says Im going to buy a macbook (mostly m1 or m2 air or something in similar price range) and trying to understand different ways to optimise this purchase. 

  
Cards I want to use (unless there is any bigger upfront discount on other bank cards):

Amex Trifecta (2 sets)

Hdfc Diners Club Metal. 

Here are my queries:

  
1. The above picture is via amex > Apple portal. I am trying to understand how this No Cost EMI Works. Like cost of m2 is 1 lakh. Does this mean I only have to pay \~92k? 

  
2. I remember having discounts/cashbacks on hdfc before and also heard that amex is the new partner. So how does this goes now. Is there any upfront discount i can get. If so how can I avail that and also get some points (either cards works for me or via coupons is also fine if there is a way). 

3. I also have student option (brother is in uni) if incase it gets me cheaper price than this discounts + rewards (unless i cant combine all these options). Like in apple store or imagine store or even reliance or similar stores.

I'm not sure if extra points are also applicable on EMI transactions or not so check that already and read the usage terms for Multiplier then follow those instructions. It has stuff like cookies clearing, no ads/tracker blockers etc. \n\nHowever, 9k points are not worth 6.5k imo but that opinion can be subjective.

Experience with Niyo Global DCB debit card on International Trip (Update on previous query),https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1fvvbzv/experience_with_niyo_global_dcb_debit_card_on/,2024-10-04,"Had previously asked about Zero Forex Cards [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1f8p5pj/zero_forex_card_for_imminently_upcoming_trip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCreditCardsHub/comments/1f8p8e2/zero_forex_card_for_imminent_international_trip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Based on the recommendations, applied for both the Niyo Global DCB card and Uni Nx Wave Yes Bank card. Niyo Global Got delivered in about 4-5 days. This mini-review is mainly about the Niyo DCB debit card. Setting up the app and the card was a fairly straightforward process. No issues there. There are things I wish I had known beforehand when I started using the card -> writing a few things below -

1. There is a 5000 INR limit for the first 24 hours for a newly added bank account if you're trying to add money via UPI. The way to circumvent this is an IMPS transfer to the DCB savings account via any bank account
2. When you are loading money for the first time, it does an SMS verification on your registered mobile number
3. When can point no 2 be a problem? -> When you don't load/forget to load money in India, and are planning to use a local pay-as-you-go SIM abroad (and not your registered number on international roaming)
4. When is point no 2 not a problem? -> If you load money in India, OR if you're using your registered mobile no. SIM with international roaming
5. I visited England via an Abu Dhabi connecting flight - I did not have to use Cash on even a single transaction in a 12-day trip spanning 4 cities. The only place where the card got declined was the London Tube - next point about that
6. London Tube allows you to directly tap your credit card at the entry and exit gates, essentially like a metro prepaid card. One Caveat with this is - if there are two of you, you can't use the same card for this purpose - as the first tap will count as an entry, and the next as an exit. So the two people need a card each for a single journey. There were two of us, and the issue got further complicated because the Niyo Card wasn't working. Luckily, I had taken my Atlas and Amex Plat Travel along, and both of them worked.

 

Overall, the Niyo Card was accepted almost everywhere except 1 transaction on the London Tube. I used it for both online and offline purchases when abroad and it saved me a decent amount of Forex Charges, without any of the hassle of a CC application process.

Meanwhile, the Uni Nx Wave card is still processing my VKYC 1 month after I applied, went on the trip, came back, and sent them 2 emails about it. Have binned their app as well since I can't be bothered whether I get that card or not anymore. AU Ixigo rejected without reason. For now, have decided to use Niyo DCB or Atlas for spends on international trips.","[""Hey all, I'm currently in Vietnam and used the niyo dcb today. I withdrew 30,00,000 vnd and the atm asked to either convert (conversation charge 8%) or pay the access fee (2%), i chose the 2% option. The total charge was 30,60,000 and my account was debited with 10560 inr. The rate it gave me 284.9 and the google rate is 290.18. that access fee is messing things up. \n\nOn top of that, niyo will charge 425(atm withdrawal fee) and 38+38 (both the gst)\n\nOverall I paid 11061 for 30L vnd.

Were you able to use tap and pay in Vietnam?', 'Hi, I used the debit card, not the CC', 'I think it is the same for Atlas - 3.5% + GST', 'Nope', 'yes, but its conditional. \n\nYou can get one complimentary lounge pass per quarter if you spend at least INR 50,000 outside India in a calendar quarter.', ""Didn't work.

Below avg. earner with more than 10 credit cards. Am i being greedy if i want more?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1f4n4jm/below_avg_earner_with_more_than_10_credit_cards/,2024-08-30,"[ignore the below avg part, cant edit it now]

So i have annual salary < 15 LPA, in IT industry & i have more than 10 credit cards.
Am i being greedy if i want more?
Is it not good?

Credit cards i currently have:

1. HDFC Millenia + Rupay (2.7L)
2. ⁠ICICI HPCL Coral (2.7L)
3. ⁠ICICI Amazon Pay (2.7L)
4. ⁠ICICI MMT Signature (2.7L)
5. ⁠Flipkart Axis (60K) - want to close this one as its pretty useless to me rn. Just keeping it as its my oldest card. Any suggestions on how to make it LTF or i'll probably close it
6. ⁠SBI Cashback (50K) - ik it has low limit but its the most useful. Suggestions on how to increase the limit? Haven't really mailed any bank regarding this
7. ⁠HSBC VISA Platinum (1.1L)
8. ⁠Standard Chartered Rewards (2.2L)
9. ⁠BoB Metal Onecard (3L)
10. ⁠AU Ixigo (3L) - 0 forex
11. ⁠Yes Uni (3L) - 0 forex
12. ⁠SBM Niyo Global (15K) - FD backed. Idk why i still keep this
13. ⁠American Express Smartearn (3L)
14. ⁠Kotak League Premier (30K) - Just kept it for offers & such

Now most of them are LTF except the following:

4. ICICI MMT Signature - upgraded from platinum. 2.5K joining. Gives a 1.5K MMT voucher. Already recovered the remaining amount via cashback from MMT Black & other offers

5. ⁠Flipkart Axis - pretty useless as i said. 749 annual charges ig

6. ⁠SBI Cashback - 749 joining + 999 annual. All charges are being recovered. Best card

13. American Express Smartearn - 499 joining & annual. Recovered joining as they gave amazon voucher of the same amount. Fulfilling annual charge waiver criteria by spending 40k/year. Kinda LTF

I recently applied for another Yes Bank partnered credit card via the AnQ app (Yes Phi & Pi cards). I was eligible according to the app, everything was done, including the video KYC. But after 2-3 days, i received an email from the bank saying they cant offer this card to me. So i googled about it & found out that Yes bank doesnt give multiple credit cards. I have sought clarification from the bank as well about this, lets see.
Also applied for airtel axis - i need this one for my airtel & utility bills.
Ik its not a good thing to apply for different cards in a short time but i needed them. The AnQ one isnt necessary but just applied as they were offering pretty good features.

Also, i have a decent CIBIL score of 781.

And i have 5-6 savings account here & there. Just mentioning as the income is distributed among them so they usually have low balances individually.

Sorry for all the blabber but i am open to suggestions & recommendations for using these cards & credit limit wisely.

Help me improve score and get good card,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1eupshd/help_me_improve_score_and_get_good_card/,2024-08-17,"I recently entered the corporate world as a fresh grad. 

I hold an Axis Priority account and applied for an Axis Select (LTF) credit card, but my application was rejected.

I desperately applied for numerous credit cards, which resulted in lowering my credit score. After failing to get any card, I settled for an FD-backed IDFC WOW card with a limit of 15K a week ago and later got a Tata Neu Plus card with a limit of 70K.

I need help improving my credit score and obtaining a better credit card. My monthly salary is 75K, and I would receive around 12.5 LPA.

My credit data:
- I have 1 Uni-Pay check of 15K.
- Many closed pay-later accounts.
- I have obtained 2 credit cards, but they have not been reported to Cibil as of now.

Help me improve my score and suggest me some good cards.

my expected spending will be:

yearly:
2-4 domestic flights
4-8 train travelling 
occasional gadgets purchase or other such purchase

monthly :
~5k online spending 
~2-3k  retail purchase.
~1-1.5k  cab service
~3.5k upi payment

I applied for the UNI Credit card(LTF & 0 Foreign Exchange) from the mobile app and everything went smoothly till VKYC(YesBank). After VKYC the uni app showed 4 days to process the card. Waited for about a week until I forgot about it. After maybe 10 days the uni application still showed 4 days and I received a call from YesBank for another round of VKYC and my office address confirmation for which I cooperated.

Then after a week I received a courier from blue dart from YesBank containing BYOC card! I thought there could be some mistake and wrote an email to YesBank keeping UNI in cc asking about LTF and Forex. For which they replied that it's a chargeable card. Meanwhile received a call from UNI team informing that my application was rejected by YesBank and whatever card I have received is from YesBank was to be checked from YesBank only.

You need to do a fresh VKYC because previous one failed as the image capture of the PAN card was blurry. I pushed back saying why it was not corrected then before rejecting my application. She says, it took time but we're doing it now. So, I do the VKYC again. 10 mins later, I get a SMS from CIBIL that Yes Bank has checked my score. Another hard inquiry, means probably a fresh application.

I flat out refuse, and told them I won't mind your BYOC if you make it LTF and will only activate it on that condition. Otherwise, it will just be auto-closed. They said they will get back to me.

I need your expertise in helping me plan and gain as much as I can. 

I've been offered 

1. Regalia Gold (LTF) by HDFC and 

2. Amex Platinum Travel card (First Year Fee: ₹3,500 + applicable taxes (Renewal Fee of ₹5,000 + taxes from second year onwards)

3. I've applied for HSBC Visa Platinum yesterday.

4. Applied for Uni NxtWave & Scapia - Both got rejected.

My CIBIL as per GPay is 791 with ICICI being my oldest card (8.5yrs but the least used as well)

What I want now? 

1. I want to learn how to use points and rewards to get flights or hotels at zero or almost zero prices. I currently have 13k points on my Amex.

2. BMS BOGO -  I wanna stop asking my friends to lend me their CC for BMS offers.

I travel once or max twice a year so unlimited lounge is good but I'm fine even if this isn't.

What are your experience with UNI-Yes bank Credit Card and other Zero Forex CC?,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1e1ds4o/what_are_your_experience_with_uniyes_bank_credit/,2024-07-12,"I wanted a Credit Card that I could use to book tickets and spend in foreign countries for studies and hence would prefer a zero forex markup card. Could anyone share their thoughts regarding the UNI cards. Also is the card issued by SBM (which could face restrictions) or Yes Bank?

I am aware that there are several other zero forex cards available but I'm not sure which would be my best option given the following:

1) Scapia - not onboarding any new customers even though the reviews suggest it's the best.

2) AU Ixigo - not issuing at my current pincode and verification would be a hassle.

3) IDFC First WOW - would prefer this but it's an FD backed Credit Card, my First preference is an unsecured card.

4) RBL Safari - the reviews suggest it a great card but the joining fees & the annual fees are relatively high.

5) Federal Amplifi - zero forex but I've read it deducts 1% forex markup which is refunded, but you need to keep contacting them everytime.

6) Niyo SBM Credit - FD backed card. SBM also seems to face issues with foreign transaction, so not reliable.

The reason that I am asking for a Credit Card rather than a Debit is to avoid the TCS upfront. As I'll study abroad, crossing the limit, I would have to pay the 20% TCS (which I can refund by filing my ITR later but It'll just take time to do so at the end of the FY) I would get the Niyo DCB Debit for Backup anyways.
